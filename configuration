Pi-hole Archlinux configuration instructions
Standalone version
rev. 0.4

It is possible to add custom ad-list server in /etc/pihole/adlists.list

Instructions below assume ArchLinux default system config files are untouched


A) First install steps

  1) edit your /etc/resolvconf.conf and uncomment name_servers line (last line), update resolvconf:

  # sed -i 's|#name_servers=127.0.0.1|name_servers=127.0.0.1|' /etc/resolvconf.conf
  # resolvconf -u

  *** if you already use dnsmasq and it's functional

    2) edit your /etc/dnsmasq.conf to uncomment last line (including new pi-hole config lines)

    # sed -i 's|#conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d/,\*.conf|' /etc/dnsmasq.conf

  *** end if

  *** if you installed dnsmasq with this package for the first time

    3) backup original dnsmasq config file and copy pi-hole one

    # cp /etc/dnsmasq.conf /etc/dnsmasq.orig
    # cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.main /etc/dnsmasq.conf

  *** end if


  4) enable and start dnsmasq service

  # systemctl reenable dnsmasq.service
  # systemctl restart dnsmasq.service


B) Upgrade steps

  *** if updating you see a post install message like this: " ==> ver. -some version-: dnsmasq conf file is changed, please follow upgrade steps "
  
    1) update dnsmasq conf file

    # [ -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig ] && cp /etc/pihole/configs/dnsmasq.complete /etc/dnsmasq.conf

    2) manage and restart dnsmasq service

    # systemctl reenable dnsmasq.service
    # systemctl restart dnsmasq.service

  *** end if


C) Uninstall steps

  # systemctl stop dnsmasq.service
  # systemctl disable dnsmasq.service
  # sed -i 's|name_servers=127.0.0.1|#name_servers=127.0.0.1|' /etc/resolvconf.conf
  # resolvconf -u
  # [ -f /etc/dnsmasq.orig ] && cp /etc/dnsmasq.orig /etc/dnsmasq.conf

[from "The Hackers' Manifesto."] 
"This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch; the beauty of the baud. We exist
without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try

that of curiosity. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."

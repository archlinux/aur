Any Oracle software identified as "Early Adopter" software is subject to the terms of the License for Early Adopter Versions provided below, and not under this Agreement. "Program Documentation" refers to Program user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available, Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may be accessed from www.oracle.com/documentation.

License Rights and Restrictions

You may allow Your Contractor(s) to use the Programs, provided they are acting on Your behalf to exercise license rights granted in this Agreement and further provided that You are responsible for their compliance with this Agreement in such use. You will have a written agreement with Your Contractor(s) that strictly limits their right to use the Programs and that otherwise protects Oracle's intellectual property rights to the same extent as this Agreement.

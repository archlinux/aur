"Oracle" refers to Oracle America, Inc. "You" and "Your" refers to
(a) a company or organization ("Entity") accessing the Programs,
if use of the Programs will be on behalf of such Entity; or (b)
an individual accessing the Programs, if use of the Programs will
not be on behalf of an Entity. "Contractors" refers to Your
agents and contractors (including, without limitation, outsourcers).

Oracle software identified as "Early Adopter" software that is
provided to You by Oracle for use in connection with a Program; (ii)
any updates and error corrections thereto; and (iii) user manuals
and installation manuals, if any, associated with any such Oracle
software identified as "Early Adopter." Any Oracle software
identified as "Early Adopter" software is subject to the terms
of the License for Early Adopter Versions provided below, and not
under this Agreement. "Program Documentation" refers to Program
user manuals and Program installation manuals, if any. If available,
Program Documentation may be delivered with the Programs and/or may
be accessed from www.oracle.com/documentation. "Separate Terms"
refers to separate license terms that are specified in the Program

License Rights and Restrictions
-------------------------------
If You have a valid, paid-up license in effect for Oracle Java
SE Subscription or Oracle Java SE Desktop Subscription, then You
acknowledge and agree that the Programs and any software identified
as "Early Adopter" software are governed by (1) the Oracle Master
Agreement and applicable ordering document that You have entered into
with Oracle for such subscription; and (2) for "Early Adopter"
software only, the additional restrictions and limitations of the
License for Early Adopter Versions titled "License Restrictions",
"Early Adopter Versions" and "Disclaimer of Warranties" and
related definitions. In the event of an inconsistency between the
applicable terms of the License for Early Adopter Versions and the
Oracle Master Agreement, the License for Early Adopter Versions shall
take precedence. If You do not have an existing license for Oracle
Java SE Subscription or Oracle Java SE Desktop Subscription then
Oracle grants You a nonexclusive, nontransferable, limited license
to internally use the Programs, subject to the restrictions stated
in this Agreement, only for the purpose of (i) OCI Use and (ii)
developing, testing, prototyping, and demonstrating Your application.
For purposes of clarity, the "developing" grant includes using
the Programs to run profilers, debuggers and Integrated Development
Environments (IDE Tools) where the primary purpose of the IDE Tools
is profiling, debugging and source code editing applications. You may
allow Your Contractor(s) to use the Programs, provided they are acting
on Your behalf to exercise license rights granted in this Agreement
and further provided that You are responsible for their compliance
with this Agreement in such use. You will have a written agreement
with Your Contractor(s) that strictly limits their right to use the
Programs and that otherwise protects Oracle's intellectual property
rights to the same extent as this Agreement. You may make copies
of the Programs to the extent reasonably necessary to exercise the
license rights granted in this Agreement. You may make copies of the
Programs to the extent reasonably necessary to exercise the license
rights granted in this Agreement.

Further, You may not:
- remove or modify any Program markings or any notice of Oracle's or
a licensor's proprietary rights;
- make the Programs, or any application You develop using the
Programs, available in any manner to any third party (other than
Contractors acting on Your behalf as set forth in this Agreement);
- assign this Agreement or distribute, give, or transfer the Programs,
or any application You develop using the Programs, or an interest
in them to any third party, except as expressly permitted in this
Agreement for Contractors (the foregoing shall not be construed to
limit the rights You may otherwise have with respect to Separately
Licensed Third Party Technology);
- cause or permit reverse engineering (unless required by law for
interoperability), disassembly or decompilation of the Programs; and
- create, modify, or change the behavior of, classes, interfaces,
or subpackages that are in any way identified as "java", "javax",
"sun", "oracle" or similar convention as specified by Oracle in
any naming convention designation.

The Programs may contain source code that, unless expressly licensed
in this Agreement for other purposes (for example, licensed under
an open source license), is provided solely for reference purposes
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and may not be modified.
All rights not expressly granted in this Agreement are reserved by
Oracle. If You want to use the Programs or Your application for any
purpose other than as expressly permitted under this Agreement,
You must obtain from Oracle or an Oracle reseller a valid Programs
license under a separate agreement permitting such use. However, You
acknowledge that the Programs may not be intended for production
use and/or Oracle may not make a version of the Programs available
for production or other purposes; any development or other work You
undertake with the Programs is at Your sole risk.

Ownership
---------
Oracle or its licensors retain all ownership and intellectual property
rights to the Programs and any software identified as Early Adopter.

Third-Party Technology
----------------------
The Programs may contain or require the use of third party technology
that is provided with the Programs. Oracle may provide certain notices
to You in Program Documentation, readmes or notice files in connection
with such third party technology. Third party technology will be
licensed to You either under the terms of this Agreement or, if
specified in the Program Documentation, readmes or notice files, under
Separate Terms. Your rights to use Separately Licensed Third Party
Technology under Separate Terms are not restricted in any way by this
Agreement. However, for clarity, notwithstanding the existence of a
notice, third party technology that is not Separately Licensed Third
Party Technology shall be deemed part of the Programs and is licensed
to You under the terms of this Agreement.

Source Code for Open Source Software
------------------------------------
For software that You receive from Oracle in binary form that is
licensed under an open source license that gives You the right to
receive the source code for that binary, You can obtain a copy of
the applicable source code from https://oss.oracle.com/sources/ or
http://www.oracle.com/goto/opensourcecode. If the source code for such
software was not provided to You with the binary, You can also receive

may transmit a limited amount of data to Oracle or its service
provider about those processes to help Oracle understand and
optimize them. Oracle does not associate the data with personally
identifiable information. Refer to Oracle's Privacy Policy at
www.oracle.com/privacy.

SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR DATA USE, INCURRED BY YOU OR ANY THIRD
PARTY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION IN CONTRACT OR TORT, EVEN IF ORACLE HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ORACLE'S ENTIRE
LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL IN NO EVENT EXCEED

Relationship Between the Parties
--------------------------------
Oracle is an independent contractor and we agree that no partnership,
joint venture, or agency relationship exists between us. We each will
be responsible for paying our own employees, including employment
related taxes and insurance. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or
distribute software that is functionally similar to the other party's
products, so long as proprietary information of the other party is not
included in such software.

Entire Agreement; Governing Law
-------------------------------
You agree that this Agreement is the complete agreement for the
Programs and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
agreements or representations, including any clickwrap, shrinkwrap
or similar licenses, or license agreements for prior versions of
the Programs. This Agreement may not be modified and the rights and
restrictions may not be altered or waived except in a writing signed
by authorized representatives of You and of Oracle. If any term of
this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
provisions will remain effective.

This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of California, USA, and You and Oracle agree to
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, the courts of
San Francisco or Santa Clara counties in California in any dispute
arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

Adopter Versions and output created by the Early Adopter Versions, or
any portion thereof, with any software that is subject to any version

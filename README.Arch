linux-status on AUR
===================

There's a Vagrantfile to make maintenance easier.  To start, use `vagrant up`,
then `vagrant ssh`.

There're a bunch of useful one-liners in Makefile.

  * Edit PKGBUILD.

  * Build the package (this also updates .SRCINFO):

      make

  * Commit the changes:

      make commit

  * Push to the AUR repository:

      make push

  * Push to upstream:

      git push

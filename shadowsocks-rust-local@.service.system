# This file is derived from the default unit file for shadowsocks-rust.
# This is the system-wide version of this unit.
#
# Users should create a new directory under /etc/shadowsocks-rust/local as the
# profile directory and place a "ss.json5" file under it.
#
# This is the configuration file passed to sslocal. For how to configure
# sslocal, see https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust#getting-started
#
# For example, if you want to name your profile "foo", you should have the
# following directory structure:
#
# /etc/shadowsocks-rust/local/foo
#   └─ ss.json5
#
# You can now enable your service like this:
#
# sudo systemctl enable --now shadowsocks-rust-local@foo.service

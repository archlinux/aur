# Set the number of CUDA streams / data sets used by mfaktc.
# NumStreams must be >= 1. In this case mfaktc can process one stream /
# data set on the GPU while the GPU can preprocess the other one. When
# NumStreams is >= 2 than the time needed to upload (CPU->GPU transfer)
# the data sets can be hidden (if the hardware supports it (most GPUs are
# supporting this)).
# On Linux systems 2 or 3 seems a good numbers. There are comments that
# Windows systems need a greater number of streams.
# A greater number increases the memory consumed by mfaktc (host and GPU
# memory). The current limit for the number of streams is 10!
# Don't be too greedy with this value, high values are usualy just a waste
# of memory.

# The GridSize affects the number of threads per grid.
# Depending on the number of multiprocessors of your GPU, too, the

#   GridSize = 1: 131072 < threads per grid <=  262144

#   GridSize = 3: 524288 < threads per grid <= 1048576 (default)
# A smaller GridSize has more overhead than a bigger GridSize for long
# running jobs. For really small jobs there can be a small benefit on
# computation time if the GridSize is small. A smaller GridSize directly
# reduces the runtime per kernel launch and might result in a better
# interactivity one older GPUs.

#  %c - class number (n/96) or (n/960) "%3d"

#  %r - rate (M/s)                     "%6.2f" / "%6.1f"
#  %s - SievePrimes                    "%7d"
#  %w - CPU wait time for GPU (us)     n.a. (mfakto only!)
#  %W - CPU wait % (%)                 "6.2f"
#  %d - date (Mon nn)                  "%b %d"  (strftime format)

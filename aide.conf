###### LOG HANDLING ######

# aide 0.18 is the first version of aide that offers infrastructure to
# track log contents on its entire way through the log rotation mechanics
# common on unxoid operating systems.

# For a detailed description of the challenges of handling logs with
# aide, see the "LOG HANDLING" section in aide.conf(5).

###### RULES ######

# Here are all the attributes we can check
#p:       permissions

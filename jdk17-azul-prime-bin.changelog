Release date: May 31, 2023

This release is based on Azul Platform Prime 23.04.0.0 and corresponds to the following OpenJDK version: 17.0.7+7-LTS

Whatâ€™s New
- Some Falcon CPU Budgeting options have been renamed:
CompilerTier2BudgetingThreadsPercent -> CompilerTier2BudgetingCPUPercent
CompilerTier2BudgetingWarmupThreadsPercent -> CompilerTier2BudgetingWarmupCPUPercent
CompilerTier2BudgetMaxMs -> CompilerTier2BudgetWindowDurationMs

- The command line option UseTrueObjectsForUnsafe has been set to true by default. This option forces unsafe objects to be returned in their true object form instead of the equivalent java class object. For example, with UseTrueObjectsForUnsafe disabled, java.class.Object can be returned instead of the true klassOop.

- Azul Platform Prime 23.05.0.0 includes several performance optimizations including many intrinsic functions implemented in the Falcon compiler.

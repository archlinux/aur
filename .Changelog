* Bump to 3.0.2

## 2023-10-26, burnoutsharp-bin 2.9.0-3

## 2023-10-26, burnoutsharp-bin 2.9.0-2

* Cleaned up some testing lines that were commented out, nothing impactful

## 2023-10-26, burnoutsharp-bin 2.9.0-1

* Bump to 2.9.0
* Project rename to `BinaryObjectScanner` imminent, distribution archive name 
has already changed

 * Remove `mono` dependency
  * Remove convenience script that simplified `mono` execution
 * Add `casclib` and `stormlib` dependencies
 * `Test` binary is now renamed during `package()` execution

None of these changes should be user-impacting.  Check the release notes, as 
there are some breaking changes in the release binary to be aware of.

## 2023-04-24, burnoutsharp-bin 2.7.0-1

* Bump to 2.7.0

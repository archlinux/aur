# burnoutsharp-bin .Changelog

## 2023-10-26, burnoutsharp-bin 2.9.0-1

* Bump to 2.9.0
* Project rename to `BinaryObjectScanner` imminent, distribution archive name 
has already changed
* Migrated from `mono`-wrapped .NET Framework 4.8 build to native .NET7 build
 * Remove `mono` dependency
  * Remove convenience script that simplified `mono` execution
 * Add `casclib` and `stormlib` dependencies
 * `Test` binary is now renamed during `package()` execution

None of these changes should be user-impacting.  Check the release notes, as 
there are some breaking changes in the release binary to be aware of.

# FAQ

## Why consume the release binary rather than compile from source?

I can't be bothered at the moment.

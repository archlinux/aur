# The lines in this file need to look like the following
#   (minus the # comment character)
# MirrorDir is the base directory for the mirrored files;
#   the rest are subdirectories where mirrored files go
#   This can start with a "~" to indicate your home directory or
#   use a full path name
# DisplayTextCommand is the command used to display files found
#   in local searches (the "draft" and "rfc" commands)
#   If DisplayTextCommand is not set, but EDITOR is set in your
#   Unix environment, EDITOR will be used.
# DisplayWebCommand is the command used to launch URLs in remote
#   commands (the "tools" and "tracker" commands). On Macintosh
#   computers, using "open " for the DisplayWebCommand usually
#   works well.

# Advanced users: if you want to change which directories are mirrored
#   by the "mirror" command, you can define actions here to replace
#   the one in the main program. You can also set defaults for the
#   following variables instead of using command-line arguments:
#      DisplayTombstones (default is False)
#      MaxTombstones (default is 10)
#      UseDraftNumbers (default is False)

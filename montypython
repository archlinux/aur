  ARTHUR:  Whoa there!
      [clop clop]
 
  GUARD #1:  Halt!  Who goes there?
  ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle
      of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign
      of all England!
  GUARD #1:  Pull the other one!
  ARTHUR:  I am.  And this my trusty servant Patsy.
      We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights
      who will join me in my court of Camelot.  I must speak with your lord
      and master.
  GUARD #1:  What, ridden on a horse?
  ARTHUR:  Yes!
  GUARD #1:  You're using coconuts!
  ARTHUR:  What?
  GUARD #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin'
      'em together.
  ARTHUR:  So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this
      land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through--
  GUARD #1:  Where'd you get the coconut?
  ARTHUR:  We found them.
  GUARD #1:  Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical!
  ARTHUR:  What do you mean?
  GUARD #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone.
  ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin
      or the plumber may seek warmer climes in winter yet these are not
      strangers to our land.
  GUARD #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
  ARTHUR:  Not at all, they could be carried.
  GUARD #1:  What -- a swallow carrying a coconut?
  ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk!
  GUARD #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple
      question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a 1 pound
      coconut.
  ARTHUR:  Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master
      that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
  GUARD #1:  Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow
      needs to beat its wings 43 times every second, right?
  ARTHUR:  Please!
  GUARD #1:  Am I right?
  ARTHUR:  I'm not interested!
  GUARD #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!
  GUARD #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European
      swallow, that's my point.
  GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah, I agree with that...
  ARTHUR:  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court
      at Camelot?!
  GUARD #1:  But then of course African swallows are not migratory.
  GUARD #2:  Oh, yeah...
  GUARD #1:  So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...
      [clop clop]
  GUARD #2:  Wait a minute -- supposing two swallows carried it together?
  GUARD #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.
  GUARD #2:  Well, simple!  They'd just use a standard creeper!
  GUARD #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
  GUARD #2:  Well, why not?

  ARTHUR:  Old woman!
  DENNIS:  Man!
  ARTHUR: Old Man, sorry.  What knight live in that castle over there?
  DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  DENNIS:  I'm thirty seven -- I'm not old!
  ARTHUR:  Well, I can't just call you `Man'.
  DENNIS:  Well, you could say `Dennis'.
  ARTHUR:  Well, I didn't know you were called `Dennis.'
  DENNIS:  Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?
  ARTHUR:  I did say sorry about the `old woman,' but from the behind
      you looked--
  DENNIS:  What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior!
  ARTHUR:  Well, I AM king...
  DENNIS:  Oh king, eh, very nice.  An' how'd you get that, eh?  By
      exploitin' the workers -- by 'angin' on to outdated imperialist dogma
      which perpetuates the economic an' social differences in our society!
      If there's ever going to be any progress--
  WOMAN:  Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh -- how d'you do?
  ARTHUR:  How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
      Who's castle is that?
  WOMAN:  King of the who?
  ARTHUR:  The Britons.
  WOMAN:  Who are the Britons?
  ARTHUR:  Well, we all are. we're all Britons and I am your king.
  WOMAN:  I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous
      collective.
  DENNIS:  You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.
      A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--
  WOMAN:  Oh there you go, bringing class into it again.
  DENNIS:  That's what it's all about if only people would--
  ARTHUR:  Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives
      in that castle?
  WOMAN:  No one live there.
  ARTHUR:  Then who is your lord?
  WOMAN:  We don't have a lord.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  DENNIS:  I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take
      it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
  ARTHUR:  Yes.
  DENNIS:  But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified
      at a special biweekly meeting.
  ARTHUR:  Yes, I see.
  DENNIS:  By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,--
  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
  DENNIS:  --but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more--
  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet!
  WOMAN:  Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
  ARTHUR:  I am your king!
  WOMAN:  Well, I didn't vote for you.
  ARTHUR:  You don't vote for kings.
  WOMAN:  Well, 'ow did you become king then?
  ARTHUR:  The Lady of the Lake,
      [angels sing]
      her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur
      from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I,
      Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.
      [singing stops]
      That is why I am your king!
  DENNIS:  Listen -- strange women lying in ponds distributing swords
      is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power
      derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical
      aquatic ceremony.
  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!
  DENNIS:  Well you can't expect to wield supreme executive power
      just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
  ARTHUR:  Shut up!
  DENNIS:  I mean, if I went around sayin' I was an empereror just
      because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me they'd
      put me away!
  ARTHUR:  Shut up!  Will you shut up!
  DENNIS:  Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.
  ARTHUR:  Shut up!
  DENNIS:  Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!
      HELP! HELP! I'm being repressed!
  ARTHUR:  Bloody peasant!
  DENNIS:  Oh, what a give away.  Did you here that, did you here that,
      eh?  That's what I'm on about -- did you see him repressing me,
      you saw it didn't you?

  VILLAGER #2:  She looks like one.
  BEDEMIR:  Bring her forward.
  WITCH:  I'm not a witch.  I'm not a witch.
  BEDEMIR:  But you are dressed as one.
  WITCH:  They dressed me up like this.
  CROWD:  No, we didn't... no.
  WITCH:  And this isn't my nose, it's a false one.
  BEDEMIR:  Well?
  VILLAGER #1:  Well, we did do the nose.
  BEDEMIR:  The nose?
  VILLAGER #1:  And the hat -- but she is a witch!

  BEDEMIR:  Did you dress her up like this?
  CROWD:  No, no... no ... yes.  Yes, yes, a bit, a bit.
  VILLAGER #1:  She has got a wart.
  BEDEMIR:  What makes you think she is a witch?
  VILLAGER #3:  Well, she turned me into a newt.

  VILLAGER #3:  I got better.
  VILLAGER #2:  Burn her anyway!
  CROWD:  Burn!  Burn her!
  BEDEMIR:  Quiet, quiet.  Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether
      she is a witch.
  CROWD:  Are there?  What are they?
  BEDEMIR:  Tell me, what do you do with witches?
  VILLAGER #2:  Burn!
  CROWD:  Burn, burn them up!
  BEDEMIR:  And what do you burn apart from witches?
  VILLAGER #1:  More witches!
  VILLAGER #2:  Wood!
  BEDEMIR:  So, why do witches burn?

  VILLAGER #3:  B--... 'cause they're made of wood...?
  BEDEMIR:  Good!
  CROWD:  Oh yeah, yeah...
  BEDEMIR:  So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?
  VILLAGER #1:  Build a bridge out of her.
  BEDEMIR:  Aah, but can you not also build bridges out of stone?
  VILLAGER #2:  Oh, yeah.
  BEDEMIR:  Does wood sink in water?
  VILLAGER #1:  No, no.
  VILLAGER #2:  It floats!  It floats!

  ARTHUR:  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
  BEDEMIR:  My liege!
  ARTHUR:  Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot,
      and join us at the Round Table?
  BEDEMIR:  My liege!  I would be honored.
  ARTHUR:  What is your name?
  BEDEMIR:  Bedemir, my leige.
  ARTHUR:  Then I dub you Sir Bedemir, Knight of the Round Table.

[Narrative Interlude]
 
  NARRATOR:  The wise Sir Bedemir was the first to join King Arthur's
      knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow:
      Sir Launcelot the Brave; Sir Galahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the
      Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Launcelot who had nearly fought the Dragon
      of Agnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol
      and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and
      the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed
      a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries,
      the Knights of the Round Table.

      doing now!?

      Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.

  GOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold!  Arthur, this is the Holy
      Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek
      this Grail. That is your purpose, Arthur -- the Quest for the

  DIRECTOR:  Action!
 
  NARRATOR:  Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened
      King Arthur.  The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely
      by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy
      was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought
      to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest
      knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail
      individually.  Now, this is what they did--

Scene 10
 
  NARRATOR:  The Tale of Sir Robin....
      So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north,
      through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.
 
  MINSTREL (singing):  
                       
                       Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.
                       He was not afraid to die, o Brave Sir Robin.
                       He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.
                       Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!
 
                       He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed
                           into a pulp,
                       Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.
                       To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away,
                       And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!
 
                       His head smashed in and his heart cut out,
                       And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged,
                       And his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off,
                       And his penis--

  ROBIN:  That's -- that's, uh, that's enough music for now, lads.
      Looks like there's dirty work afoot.
  DENNIS:  Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.
  WOMAN:  Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  Now I've dropped my mud.
  ALL HEADS:  Halt!  Who art thou?
  MINSTREL (singing):  He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--
  ROBIN:  Shut up!  Um, n-n-nobody really, I'm j-just um, just passing
      through.
  ALL HEADS:  What do you want?
  MINSTREL (singing):  To fight, and--
  ROBIN:  Shut up!  Um, oo, n-nothing, nothing really -- I, uh, j-j-ust
      to um, just to p-pass through, good Sir knight.
  ALL HEADS:  I'm afraid not!
  ROBIN:  Ah.  W-well, actually I am a Knight of the Round Table.
  ALL HEADS:  You're a Knight of the Round Table?
  ROBIN:  I am.
  LEFT HEAD:  In that case I shall have to kill you.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Shall I?
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, I don't think so.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Well, what do I think?
  LEFT HEAD:  I think kill him.
  RIGHT HEAD:  Well let's be nice to him.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Oh shut up.
  LEFT HEAD:  Perhaps-
  MIDDLE HEAD:  And you.
  LEFT HEAD:  Oh quick get the sword out I want to cut his head off!
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, cut your own head off!
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Yes, do us all a favor!
  LEFT HEAD:  What?
  RIGHT HEAD:  Yapping on all the time.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  You're lucky.  You're not next to him.
  LEFT HEAD:  What do you mean?
  MIDDLE HEAD:  You snore.
  LEFT HEAD:  Oh I don't -- anyway, you've got bad breath.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Well its only because you don't brush my teeth.
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.
  LEFT HEAD:  All right, all right, all right.  We'll kill him first
      and then have tea and biscuits.
  MIDDLE HEAD:  Yes.
  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, but not biscuits.
  LEFT HEAD:  All right, all right, not biscuits, but lets kill him anyway.
  ALL HEADS:  Right!
  LEFT HEAD:  He buggered off.
  RIGHT HEAD:  So he has, he's scarpered.
 
  MINSTREL (singing):  Brave Sir Robin ran away
  ROBIN:  No!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Bravely ran away away
  ROBIN:  I didn't!
  MINSTREL (singing):  When danger reared its ugly head,
                       He bravely turned his tail and fled
  ROBIN:  No!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Yes Brave Sir Robin turned about
  ROBIN:  I didn't!
  MINSTREL (singing):  And gallantly he chickened out
                       Bravely taking to his feet
  ROBIN:  I never did!
  MINSTREL (singing):  He beat a very brave retreat
  ROBIN:  Oh, lie!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Bravest of the brave Sir Robin
  ROBIN:  I never!

      Open the door!

      In the name of King Arthur, open the door!

  ALL:  Hello!
  ZOOT:  Welcome gentle Sir knight, welcome to the Castle Anthrax.
  GALAHAD:  The Castle Anthrax?
  ZOOT:  Yes... oh, it's not a very good name?  Oh! but we are
      nice and we shall attend to your every, every need!
  GALAHAD:  You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
  ZOOT:  The what?
  GALAHAD:  The Grail -- it is here?
  ZOOT:  Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!
      Crepper!
  MIDGET and CREPPER:  Yes, oh Zoot!
  ZOOT:  Prepare a bed for our guest.
  MIDGET and CREPPER:  Oh thank you thank you thank you--
  ZOOT:  Away away vile temptress!  The beds here are warm and soft -- and
      very, very big.
  GALAHAD:  Well, look, I-I-uh--
  ZOOT:  What is your name, handsome knight?
  GALAHAD:  Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
  ZOOT:  Mine is Zoot... just Zoot.  Oh, but come!
  GALAHAD:  Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!
  ZOOT:  Oh, you have suffered much!  You are delirious!
  GALAHAD:  L-look, I have seen it!  It is here, in the--
  ZOOT:  Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our
      hospitality.
  GALAHAD:  Well, I-I-uh--
  ZOOT:  Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared
      to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between
      sixteen and nineteen and a half, cut off in this castle with no one to
      protect us!  Oh, it is a lonely life -- bathing, dressing, undressing,
      making exciting underwear....  We are just not used to handsome knights.
      Nay, nay, come, come, you may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!
  GALAHAD:  No, no -- i-it's nothing!
  ZOOT:  Oh, but you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please,
      lie down.
      [clap clap]
  PIGLET:  Ah.  What seems to be the trouble?
  GALAHAD:  They're doctors?!
  ZOOT:  Uh, they've had a basic medical training, yes.
  GALAHAD:  B-but--
  ZOOT:  Oh, come come, you must try to rest!  Doctor Piglet,  Doctor
      Winston, practice your art.
  PIGLET:  Try to relax.
  GALAHAD:  Are you sure that's necessary?
  PIGLET:  We must examine you.
  GALAHAD:  There's nothing wrong with that!
  PIGLET:  Please -- we are doctors.
  GALAHAD:  Get off the bed!  I am sworn to chastity!
  PIGLET:  Back to your bed!
  GALAHAD:  Torment me no longer!  I have seen the Grail!
  PIGLET:  There's no grail here.
  GALAHAD:  I have seen it, I have seen it.  I have seen--
  GIRLS:  Hello.
  GALAHAD:  Oh--
  VARIOUS GIRLS:  Hello.
      Hello.

  GALAHAD:  Zoot!
  DINGO:  No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.
  GALAHAD:  Oh, well, excuse me, I--
  DINGO:  Where are you going?
  GALAHAD:  I seek the Grail!  I have seen it, here in this castle!
  DINGO:  No!  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!
  GALAHAD:  What is it?
  DINGO:  Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight
      to our beacon, which, I just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the
      first time we've had this problem.
  GALAHAD:  It's not the real Grail?
  DINGO:  Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  Oh, she is a naughty
      person, and she must pay the penalty -- and here in Castle Anthrax, we
      have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You
      must tie her down on a bed and spank her!
  GIRLS:  A spanking!  A spanking!
  DINGO:  You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you
      may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.
  VARIOUS GIRLS:  And spank me.
      And me.
      And me.
  DINGO:  Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!
  GIRLS:  A spanking!  A spanking!
  DINGO:  And after the spanking, the oral sex.
  GIRLS:  Oral sex!  Oral sex!
  GALAHAD:  Well, I could stay a BIT longer.
  LAUNCELOT:  Sir Galahad!
  GALAHAD:  Oh, hello.
  LAUNCELOT:  Quick!
  GALAHAD:  What?
  LAUNCELOT:  Quick!
  GALAHAD:  Why?
  LAUNCELOT:  You're in great peril!
  LAUNCELOT:  Silence, foul temptress!
  GALAHAD:  Now look, it's not important.
  LAUNCELOT:  Quick!  Come on and we'll cover your escape!
  GALAHAD:  Look, I'm fine!
  LAUNCELOT:  Come on!
  GALAHAD:  Now look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!
  DINGO:  Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!
  GIRLS:  Yes!  Tackle us single-handed!
  LAUNCELOT:  No, Sir Galahad, come on!
  GALAHAD:  No, really, honestly, I can go back and handle this lot easily!
  DINGO:  Oh, yes, he can handle us easily.
  GIRLS:  Yes, yes!
  GALAHAD:  Wait!  I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred and fifty
      of them!
  DINGO:  Yes, yes, he'll beat us easily, we haven't a chance.
  GIRLS:  Yes, yes.
      [boom]
  DINGO:  Oh, shit.
      [outside]
  LAUNCELOT:  We were in the nick of time, you were in great peril.
  GALAHAD:  I don't think I was.
  LAUNCELOT:  Yes you were, you were in terrible peril.
  GALAHAD:  Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.
  LAUNCELOT:  No, it's too perilous.
  GALAHAD:  Look, I'm a knight, I'm supposed to get as much peril as I can.
  LAUNCELOT:  No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!
  GALAHAD:  Well, let me have just a little bit of peril?
  LAUNCELOT:  No, it's unhealthy.
  GALAHAD:  Bet you're gay!
  LAUNCELOT:  No, I'm not.

Narrative Interlude 2
 
  NARRATOR:  Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain
      temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile,
      King Arthur and Sir Bedemir, not more than a swallow's flight away,
      had  discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight,
      obviously. I mean, they were more than two laden swallow's flights
      away -- four, really, if they hadn't a cord of line between them.
      I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--
  CROWD:  Get on with it!
  NARRATOR:  Oh, anyway, on to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing
      scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue,
      in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a
      starling -oolp!

Scene 24
 
  OLD MAN:  Ah, hee he he ha!
  ARTHUR:  And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the grail?
  OLD MAN:  Ha ha he he he he!
  ARTHUR:  Where does he live?  Old man, where does he live?
  OLD MAN:  He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered.
  ARTHUR:  And the Grail... The Grail is there?
  OLD MAN:  Very much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge
      of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.
  ARTHUR:  But the Grail!  Where is the Grail!?
  OLD MAN:  Seek you the Bridge of Death.
  ARTHUR:  The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?
  OLD MAN:  Hee hee ha ha!

  ARTHUR:  Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  The Knights Who Say Nee demand a sacrifice!
  ARTHUR:  Knights of Nee, we are but simple travellers who seek the
      enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Nee!  Nee!  Nee!  Nee!
  ARTHUR and PARTY:  Oh, ow!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  We shall say 'nee' again to you if you do not appease us.
  ARTHUR:  Well, what is it you want?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  We want... a shrubbery!
      [dramatic chord]
  ARTHUR:  A what?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Nee!  Nee!
  ARTHUR and PARTY:  Oh, ow!
  ARTHUR:  Please, please!  No more!  We shall find a shrubbery.
  HEAD KNIGHT:  You must return here with a shrubbery or else you will
      never pass through this wood alive!
  ARTHUR:  O Knights of Nee, you are just and fair, and we will return
      with a shrubbery.
  HEAD KNIGHT:  One that looks nice.
  ARTHUR:  Of course.
  HEAD KNIGHT:  And not too expensive.
  ARTHUR:  Yes.

  NARRATOR:  The Tale of Sir Launcelot.
 
  FATHER:  One day, lad, all this will be yours!
  ERBERT:  What, the curtains?
  FATHER:  No, not the curtains, lad.  All that you can see!  Stretched
      out over the hills and valleys of this land!  This'll be your kingdom,
      lad!
  HERBERT:  But, Mother--
  FATHER:  Father, I'm Father.
  HERBERT:  But Father, I don't want any of that.
  FATHER:  Listen, lad.  I've built this kingdom up from nothing.  When
      I started here, all there was was swamp.  All the kings said I was
      daft to build a castle in a swamp, but I built it all the same,
      just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.
      That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down,
      fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one stayed up.
      An' that's what your gonna get, lad -- the strongest castle in these
      islands.
  HERBERT:  But I don't want any of that -- I'd rather--
  FATHER:  Rather what?!
  HERBERT:  I'd rather... just...
      [music]
      ...sing!
  FATHER:  Stop that, stop that!  You're not going to do a song while
      I'm here.  Now listen lad, in twenty minutes you're getting married to
      a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.
  HERBERT:  But I don't want land.
  FATHER:  Listen, Alex,--
  HERBERT:  Herbert.
  FATHER:  Herbert.  We live in a bloody swamp.  We need all the land we
      can get.
  HERBERT:  But I don't like her.
  FATHER:  Don't like her?!  What's wrong with her?  She's beautiful,
      she's rich, she's got huge... tracts of land.
  HERBERT:  I know, but I want the girl that I marry to have...
      a certain... special...
      [music]
      ...something...
  FATHER:  Cut that out, cut that out.  Look, you're marryin' Princess
      Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea. [smack]  Guards!  Make sure
      the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get 'im.
  GUARD #1:  Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.
  GUARD #2:  Hic!
  FATHER:  No, no.  Until I come and get 'im.
  GUARD #1:  Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.
  FATHER:  No, no, no.  You stay in the room and make sure 'e doesn't
      leave.
  GUARD #1:  And you'll come and get him.
  GUARD #2:  Hic!
  FATHER:  Right.
  GUARD #1:  We don't need to do anything, apart from just stop him
      entering the room.
  FATHER:  No, no.  Leaving the room.
  GUARD #1:  Leaving the room, yes.
  FATHER:  All right?
  GUARD #1:  Right.  Oh, if-if-if, uh, if-if-if, uh, if-if-if we...
  FATHER:  Yes, what is it?
  GUARD #1:  Oh, if-if, oh--
  FATHER:  Look, it's quite simple.
  GUARD #1:  Uh...
  FATHER:  You just stay here, and make sure 'e doesn't leave the room.
      All right?
  GUARD #2:  Hic!
  FATHER:  Right.
  GUARD #1:  Oh, I remember.  Uh, can he leave the room with us?
  FATHER:  N- No no no.  You just keep him in here, and make sure--
  GUARD #1:  Oh, yes, we'll keep him in here, obviously.  But if he had
      to leave and we were--
  FATHER:  No, no, just keep him in here--
  GUARD #1:  Until you, or anyone else,--
  FATHER:  No, not anyone else, just me--
  GUARD #1:  Just you.
  GUARD #2:  Hic!
  FATHER:  Get back.
  GUARD #1:  Get back.
  FATHER:  Right?
  GUARD #1:  Right, we'll stay here until you get back.
  FATHER:  And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.
  GUARD #1:  What?
  FATHER:  Make sure 'e doesn't leave.
  GUARD #1:  The Prince?
  FATHER:  Yes, make sure 'e doesn't leave.
  GUARD #1:  Oh, yes, of course.  I thought you meant him.  Y'know, it
      seemed a bit daft, me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.
  FATHER:  Is that clear?
  GUARD #2:  Hic!
  GUARD #1:  Oh, quite clear, no problems.
  FATHER:  Right.
      [starts to leave]
      Where are you going?
  GUARD #1:  We're coming with you.
  FATHER:  No no, I want you to stay 'ere and make sure 'e doesn't leave.
  GUARD #1:  Oh, I see.  Right.

  FATHER:  Did you kill all the guard?
  LAUNCELOT:  Uh..., oh, yes.  Sorry.
  FATHER:  They cost fifty pounds each.
  LAUNCELOT:  Well, I'm awfully sorry, I'm -- I really can explain everything.
  HERBERT:  Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot, I've got a rope all ready!
  FATHER:  You killed eight wedding guests in all!
  LAUNCELOT:  Well, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady.
  FATHER:  I can understand that.
  HERBERT:  Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry!
  FATHER:  Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all!
  LAUNCELOT:  Well, I really didn't mean to...
  FATHER:  Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, dear.  Is he all right?
  FATHER:  You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost
      me a fortune!
  LAUNCELOT:  Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north
      from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--
  FATHER:  Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?
  HERBERT:  Hurry, Sir Launcelot!
  LAUNCELOT:  Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.

      witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy
      wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen
      to his death.  But I think I've not lost a son, so much as... gained
      a daughter!  For, since the tragic death of her father--
  RANDOM:  He's not quite dead!
  FATHER:  Since the near fatal wounding of her father--

  FATHER:  And I want his only daughter to look upon me... as her own

Scene 30
 
      [clop clop]
  ARTHUR:  Old crone!  Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy
  a shrubbery!
      [dramatic chord]
  CRONE:  Who sent you?
  ARTHUR:  The Knights Who Say Nee.
  CRONE:  Agh!  No!  Never!  We have no shrubberies here.
  ARTHUR:  If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend
      and I will say... we will say... `nee'.
  CRONE:  Agh!  Do your worst!
  ARTHUR:  Very well!  If you will not assist us voluntarily,... nee!
  CRONE:  No!  Never!  No shrubberies!
  ARTHUR:  Nee!
  BEDEMIR:  Noo!  Noo!
  ARTHUR:  No, no, no, no -- it's not that, it's 'nee'.
  BEDEMIR:  Noo!
  ARTHUR:  No, no -- 'nee'.  You're not doing it properly.
  BEDEMIR:  Noo!  Nee!
  ARTHUR:  That's it, that's it, you've got it.
  ARTHUR and BEDEMIR:  Nee!  Nee!
  ROGER:  Are you saying 'nee' to that old woman?
  ARTHUR:  Um, yes.
  ROGER:  Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say `nee'
      at will to old ladies.  There is a pestilence upon this land, nothing
      is sacred.  Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under
      considerable economic stress at this period in history.
  ARTHUR:  Did you say `shrubberies'?
  ROGER:  Yes, shrubberies are my trade -- I am a shrubber.  My name
      is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.
  BEDEMIR:  Nee!
  ARTHUR:  No!  No, no, no!  No!

Scene 31
 
  ARTHUR:  O, Knights of Nee, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we
      go now?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.
      But there is one small problem.
  ARTHUR:  What is that?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  We are now... no longer the Knights Who Say Nee.
  RANDOM:  Nee!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Shh shh.  We are now the Knights Who Say Ecky-ecky-ecky-
      ecky-pikang-zoom-boing-mumble-mumble.
  RANDOM:  Nee!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Therefore, we must give you a test.
  ARTHUR:  What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently
      Said Nee?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery!
      [dramatic chord]
  ARTHUR:  Not another shrubbery!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place
      it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get a
      two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.
  RANDOM:  A path!  A path!  Nee!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut
      down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!
      [dramatic chord]
  ARTHUR:  We shall do no such thing!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Oh, please!
  ARTHUR:  Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done.
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!  Aaaugh!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Don't say that word.
  ARTHUR:  What word?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words
      the Knights of Nee cannot hear.
  ARTHUR:  How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!  Aaaugh!
  ARTHUR:  What, `is'?
  HEAD KNIGHT:  No, not `is' -- we couldn't get vary far in life not
      saying `is'.
  BEDEMIR:  My liege, it's Sir Robin!
  MINSTREL (singing):  Packing it in and packing it up
                       And sneaking away and buggering up
                       And chickening out and pissing about
                       Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge
  ARTHUR:  Oh, Robin!
  ROBIN:  My liege!  It's good to see you!
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  He said the word!
  ARTHUR:  Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?
  MINSTREL (singing):  He is sneaking away and buggering up--
  ROBIN:  Shut up!  No, no no-- far from it.
  HEAD KNIGHT:  He said the word again!
  ROBIN:  I was looking for it.
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
  ROBIN:  Uh, here, here in this forest.
  ARTHUR:  No, it is far from--
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!
  ARTHUR:  Oh, stop it!
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!

  ARTHUR:  Patsy!
  HEAD KNIGHT:  Aaugh!  I said it!  I said it!  Ooh!  I said it again!

Narrative Interlude 3
 
  NARRATOR:  And so Arthur and Bedemir and Sir Robin set out on their
      search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in Scene 24.
      Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much
      rejoicing.
  ALL:  Yay!  Yay!
  NARRATOR:  In the frozen land of Nador they were forced to eat Robin's
      minstrels.  And there was much rejoicing.
  ALL:  Yay!
  NARRATOR:  A year passed.  Winter changed into Spring.  Spring changed
      into Summer.  Summer changed back into Winter.  And Winter gave Spring
      and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn.  Until one day...

Scene 32
 
  ARTHUR:  Knights!  Forward!
      [boom boom boom boom BOOM boom boom boom boom]
      What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint
      or tinder?
  TIM:  I... am an enchanter.
  ARTHUR:  By what name are you known?
  TIM:  There are some who call me... Tim?
  ARTHUR:  Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.
  TIM:  Greetings, King Arthur!
  ARTHUR:  You know my name?
  TIM:  I do.
      [zoosh]
      You seek the Holy Grail!
  ARTHUR:  That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden, O Tim.
  TIM:  Quite.
      [pweeng boom]
      [clap clap clap]
  ARTHUR:  Yes, we're, we're looking for the Grail.  Our quest is to find
      the Holy Grail.
  KNIGHTS:  It is, yes, yup, yes, yeah.
  ARTHUR:  And so we're, we're, we're, we're looking for it.
  KNIGHTS:  Yes we are we are.
  BEDEMIR:  We have been for some time.
  ROBIN:  Ages.
  ARTHUR:  Uh, so, uh, anything you can do to, uh, to help, would be...
      very... helpful...
  GALAHAD:  Look, can you tell us wh-
      [boom]
  ARTHUR:  Fine, um, I don't want to waste anymore of your time, but, uh
      I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find a, um,
      find a, uh, a, um, a uh--
  TIM:  A what...?
  ARTHUR:  A g--, a g--
  TIM:  A Grail?!
  ARTHUR:  Yes, I think so.
  KNIGHTS:  Yes, that's it.  Yes.
  TIM:  Yes!
  KNIGHTS:  Oh, thank you, splendid, fine.
      [boom pweeng boom boom]
  ARTHUR:  Look, you're a busy man, uh--
  TIM:  Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.
  KNIGHTS:  Oh, thank you.
  TIM:  To the north there lies a cave -- the cave of Kyre Banorg --
      wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last
      words of Ulfin Bedweer of Regett [boom] proclaim the last resting
      place of the most Holy Grail.
  ARTHUR:  Where could we find this cave, O Tim?
  TIM:  Follow!  But! follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance
      to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man
      yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of four fifty men lie strewn
      about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or
      your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty
      big pointy teeth.
  ARTHUR:  What an eccentric performance.

      [clop clop whinny]
  KNIGHT:  They're nervous, sire.
  ARTHUR:  Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.  Dis-mount!
  TIM:  Behold the cave of Kyre Banorg!
  ARTHUR:  Right!  Keep me covered.
  KNIGHT:  What with?
  ARTHUR:  Just keep me covered.
  TIM:  Too late!

  ARTHUR:  What?
  TIM:  There he is!
  ARTHUR:  Where?
  TIM:  There!
  ARTHUR:  What, behind the rabbit?
  TIM:  It is the rabbit!
  ARTHUR:  You silly sod!  You got us all worked up!
  TIM:  Well, that's no ordinary rabbit.  That's the most foul, cruel,
      and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.
  ROBIN:  You tit!  I soiled my armor I was so scared!
  TIM:  Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide, it's a
      killer!
  KNIGHT:  Get stuffed!
  TIM:  It'll do you a trick, mate!
  KNIGHT:  Oh, yeah?
  ROBIN:  You mangy Scot git!
  TIM:  I'm warning you!
  ROBIN:  What's he do, nibble your bum?
  TIM:  He's got huge, sharp-- he can leap about-- look at the bones!
  ARTHUR:  Go on, Boris.  Chop his head off!
  BORIS:  Right!  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew comin' right up!
  TIM:  Look!

  BORIS:  Aaaugh!

  ARTHUR:  Jesus Christ!
  TIM:  I warned you!
  ROBIN:  I peed again!
  TIM:  I warned you!  But did you listen to me?  Oh, no, you knew it all,
      didn't you?  Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?  Well,
      it's always the same,  I always--
  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up!
  TIM:  --But do they listen to me?--
  ARTHUR:  Right!
  TIM:  -Oh, no--
  KNIGHTS:  Charge!
      [squeak squeak]
  KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!  Aaaugh! etc.
  KNIGHTS:  Run away!  Run away!
  TIM:  Haw haw haw.  Haw haw haw.  Haw haw.
  ARTHUR:  Right.  How many did we lose?
  KNIGHT:  Gawain.
  KNIGHT:  Hector.
  ARTHUR:  And Boris.  That's five.
  GALAHAD:  Three, sir.
  ARTHUR:  Three.  Three.  And we'd better not risk another frontal
      assault, that rabbit's dynamite.
  ROBIN:  Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?
  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.
  GALAHAD:  Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make
      a mistake.
  ARTHUR:  Like what?
  GALAHAD:  Well,....
  ARTHUR:  Have we got bows?
  KNIGHT:  No.
  LAUNCELOT:  We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
  ARTHUR:  Yes, of course!  The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch!  'Tis one
      of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him!  Brother Maynard!
      Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!
      [singing]
      How does it, uh... how does it work?
  KNIGHT:  I know not, my liege.
  ARTHUR:  Consult the Book of Armaments!
  MAYNARD:  Armaments, Chapter Two, Verses Nine to Twenty-One.
  BROTHER:  "And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,
      'Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow
      thy enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.'  And the Lord did grin, and
      people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, and anchovies,
      and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats, and large --"
  MAYNARD:  Skip a bit, Brother.
  BROTHER:  "And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the
      Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three
      shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting
      shalt be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two,
      excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once
      the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou
      thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thou foe, who being naughty
      in my sight, shall snuff it.'"
  MAYNARD:  Amen.
  ALL:  Amen.
  ARTHUR:  Right!  One... two... five!
  KNIGHT:  Three, sir!

Scene 34
 
  KNIGHT:  There!  Look!
  LAUNCELOT:  What does it say?
  GALAHAD:  What language is that?
  ARTHUR:  Brother Maynard, you're our scholar!
  MAYNARD:  It's Aramaic!
  GALAHAD:  Of course!  Joseph of Aramathea!
  LAUNCELOT:  Course!
  KNIGHT:  What does it say?
  MAYNARD:  It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of
      Aramathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail
      in the Castle of uuggggggh'.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  MAYNARD: '... the Castle of uuggggggh'.
  BEDEMIR:  What is that?
  MAYNARD:  He must have died while carving it.
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, come on!
  MAYNARD:  Well, that's what it says.
  ARTHUR:  Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.
      He'd just say it!
  MAYNARD:  Well, that's what's carved in the rock!
  GALAHAD:  Perhaps he was dictating.
  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?
  MAYNARD:  No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'.
  LAUNCELOT:  Aauuggghhh.
  KNIGHT:  Aaauggh.
  BEDEMIR:  You don't suppose he meant the Camauuuugh?
  KNIGHT:  Where's that?
  BEDEMIR:  France, I think.
  LAUNCELOT:  Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?
  ARTHUR:  No, that's Saint Ives.
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, yes.  Saint Iiiives.
  SEVERAL:  Iiiiives.
  BEDEMIR:  Oooohoohohooo!
  LAUNCELOT:  No, no, aauuuuugh, at the back of the throat.  Aauuugh.
  BEDEMIR:  No, no, no, oooooooh, in surprise and alarm.
  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, you mean sort of a aaaagh!
  BEDEMIR:  Yes, but I-- Aaaaagh!
  KNIGHT:  Oooh!
  KNIGHT:  Oh, no!

  MAYNARD:  It's the legendary Black Beast of aaauuugh!
  ARTHUR:  Run away!
  ALL:  Run away!  Run away!

  NARRATOR:  As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape
      for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless.  When, suddenly, the
      animator suffered a fatal heart attack.  [ulk]  The cartoon peril
      was no more.  The Quest for the Holy Grail could continue.

  ARTHUR:  He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.  He asks each
      traveller five questions--
  KNIGHT:  Three questions.
  ARTHUR:  Three questions.  He who answers the five questions--
  KNIGHT:  Three questions.
  ARTHUR:  Three questions may cross in safety.
  ROBIN:  What if you get a question wrong?
  ARTHUR:  Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

  KNIGHT:  Who's going to answer the questions?
  ARTHUR:  Sir Robin!
  ROBIN:  Yes?
  ARTHUR:  Brave Sir Robin, you go.
  ROBIN:  Hey!  I've got a great idea.  Why doesn't Launcelot go?
  LAUNCELOT:  Yes, let me go, my liege.  I will take him single-handed.
      I shall make a feint to the north-east--
  ARTHUR:  No, no, hang on, hang on, hang on!  Just answer the five
      questions--
  KNIGHT:  Three questions.
  ARTHUR:  Three questions as best you can.  And we shall watch... and
      pray.
  LAUNCELOT:  I understand, my liege.
  ARTHUR:  Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot.  God be with you.
  KEEPER:  Stop!  Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me

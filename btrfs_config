# It is possible to move and replace BTRFS_DIR_ACTIVE with an older snapshot
# while it is mounted and reboot afterwards. If you prefer to rollback like
# this, you can optionally disable the on-boot rollback dialog. This will

# By default we reload the kernel image from the chosen boot root subvolume
# only if the version and build-number/date differs from `uname -rv`.

# If you want to reload the kernel on every boot, you can disable this check.

# Try to mount RAID setups, when there are devices missing.
#
# This is usualy wanted on productive setups, because btrfs supports to
# replace faulty drives online.

# ATTENTION: If you enable this, you need to make sure to rebalance the btrfs
# RAID after system upgrade. Otherwise kernal panic is possible by unbalanced
# libraries.

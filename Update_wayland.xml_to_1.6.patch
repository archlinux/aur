+	When a client is animating on a wl_surface, it can use the 'frame'

+	requested again. For a wl_surface, the notifications are posted in
+	the order the frame requests were committed.
+
+	The server must send the notifications so that a client
+	will not send excessive updates, while still allowing
+	the highest possible update rate for clients that wait for the reply
+	before drawing again. The server should give some time for the client
+	to draw and commit after sending the frame callback events to let them
+	hit the next output refresh.
 
 	A server should avoid signalling the frame callbacks if the
 	surface is not visible in any way, e.g. the surface is off-screen,
 	or completely obscured by other opaque surfaces.
 
-	A client can request a frame callback even without an attach,
-	damage, or any other state changes. wl_surface.commit triggers a
-	display update, so the callback event will arrive after the next
-	output refresh where the surface is visible.

 	The object returned by this request will be destroyed by the

 	attempt to use it after that point.

# Place in /etc/obdevicemenu.conf for system wide configuration.
# Place in ~/.config/obdevicemenu/config for per-user configuration.
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME is respected if it has been set.

# Set filemanager command. The mount point is passed as the first argument.

# Set whether notifications will be shown. This can be "0" or "1".
show_notifications="1"

# Set notification command path and options to pass. These are only used if
# show_notifications is set to "1". The messages are passed to this command
# as the final argument. notify_options can be left blank if you do not need
# to pass any options to the notification command.

# Set optical device location. This string is matched using grep like so:
# udisks --enumerate-device-files | grep -ow ${optical_devices} | sort
# See the grep man page for more information.
optical_devices="-E ^/dev/sr[0-9]+"

# Set removable devices location. The default is to ignore /dev/sda*, which is
# usually the primary system drive. Devices such as SD card readers show up as
# /dev/mmcblk* and are also matched. This string is matched using grep like so:
# udisks --enumerate-device-files | grep -ow ${removable_devices} | sort
# See the grep man page for more information.
removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/mmcblk[0-9]+p*[0-9]*"

###
### This example also includes LUKS encrypted partitions:
### removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/mmcblk[0-9]+p*[0-9]*|^/dev/dm-[0-9]+"
###
### This example also includes LUKS encrypted partitions but hides /dev/dm-0 to
### /dev/dm-7 which are system partitions:
### removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/dm-[8-9]|^/dev/dm-[1-9][0-9]+"
###
### This example also includes floppy drives (note that the device will always
### be shown whether or not there is a floppy disk inserted):
### removable_devices="-E ^/dev/sd[b-z][0-9]*|^/dev/fd[0-9]+"
###

# Set whether to show internal devices. This can be "0" or "1". If you have
# system drives that are always found at the same location (e.g. /dev/sda),
# it is better and faster to hide them using the "removable_devices" option.
show_internal="0"

# Set devices to blacklist. Any device whose "udisks --show-info" output
# contains a string listed here will be hidden. The strings are matched
# using "grep -E". The pipe menu does not display underscores, so the label
# shown by obdevicemenu may not be the real device label that must be matched
# here. In that case, check for the real label using "udisks --show-info".
blacklist=( )

###
### This example will match any device with "Photosmart" in any field.
### blacklist+=( 'Photosmart' )
###
### This example matches only the model field, to reduce false positives.
### blacklist+=( 'model: * Photosmart C4400' )
###
### This example matches several different devices. Note that the array can be
### split over multiple lines for convenience.
### blacklist+=( 'by-id: * /dev/disk/by-id/ata-ST9250410AS_5VG8EAYT-part4' )
### blacklist+=( 'label: * secret' )
### blacklist+=( 'vendor: * Huawei' )

# Set default mount options for Udisks.

# Set whether to show the device filename in the menu. This can be "0" or "1".

show_removable_device_filename="1"
show_optical_device_filename="1"

# Set whether to sort devices more thoroughly. This can be "0" or "1".
# This option is basically a big hack to get around a shortcoming of the sort
# command, which causes /dev/sdc11 to be shown in the menu before /dev/sdc2.
# It will deal with /dev/sd* and /dev/dm-* devices, but not /dev/mmcblk* as
# the sorting is not really that simple. It is a big hack so if you enable it
# then i can make no promises that it will be fast or bug free.

# Set custom commands to be run automatically after mounting or unmounting.
# This is useful for spinning down a hard drive after unmounting it. The
# device name (e.g. /dev/sdb1) is passed as the first and only argument.
# Uncomment the examples below, or modify them to pass any arbitrary commands.
# post_mount is run immediately after a successful mount operation, and
# post_unmount is run immediately after a successful unmount operation.

# Set "run_post_mount" to "0" to disable or "1" to enable.
run_post_mount="0"

# This example uses udisks to set the spindown timeout after mounting.
#post_mount() {
#	udisks --set-spindown ${1} --spindown-timeout 240
#}

# Set "run_post_unmount" to "0" to disable or "1" to enable.
run_post_unmount="0"

# This example uses udisks to set the spindown timeout after unmounting.
#post_unmount() {
#	udisks --set-spindown ${1} --spindown-timeout 240

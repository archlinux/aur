# Options from pacman-pb
# Defines what pacman should draw as the "progress done",
# "current progress" and "missing progress". If "current"
# is not provided, it'll use "missing" instead.
# All characters should be the same width as otherwise displayment errors can occur (i.e no done=# , current=CCC, missing=.)
#ProgressCharDone = #
#ProgressCharCurrent = C
#ProgressCharMissing = .
# Specify here the width your characters above are using (for the above example this would be "1")
# However, some characters display thicker than others.
# "🐸" for example, takes twice the space as ".". Since all characters need to be the same width,
# this would need to get adjusted by using "." twice, and then specifying the width as 2 (i.e. done=🐸, missing=.., width=2)
# Specifying 0 will result in pacman to try to automatically figure that out, with mixed results.
#ProgressCharWidth = 0

# By default, pacman accepts packages signed by keys that its local keyring
# trusts (see pacman-key and its man page), as well as unsigned packages.
SigLevel    = Required DatabaseOptional
LocalFileSigLevel = Optional
#RemoteFileSigLevel = Required

# NOTE: You must run `pacman-key --init` before first using pacman; the local
# keyring can then be populated with the keys of all official Arch Linux
# packagers with `pacman-key --populate archlinux`.

#
# REPOSITORIES
#   - can be defined here or included from another file
#   - pacman will search repositories in the order defined here
#   - local/custom mirrors can be added here or in separate files
#   - repositories listed first will take precedence when packages
#     have identical names, regardless of version number
#   - URLs will have $repo replaced by the name of the current repo
#   - URLs will have $arch replaced by the name of the architecture
#
# Repository entries are of the format:
#       [repo-name]
#       Server = ServerName
#       Include = IncludePath
#
# The header [repo-name] is crucial - it must be present and
# uncommented to enable the repo.
#

# The testing repositories are disabled by default. To enable, uncomment the
# repo name header and Include lines. You can add preferred servers immediately
# after the header, and they will be used before the default mirrors.

#[testing]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[core]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

[extra]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

#[community-testing]

[community]

# If you want to run 32 bit applications on your x86_64 system,
# enable the multilib repositories as required here.

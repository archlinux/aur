## Changes in 1.7.0

### Scripts

XPipe 1.7 comes with a new scripting system, you now can take your environment everywhere.
The idea is to create modular and reusable init scripts in XPipe that will be run on login but are independent of your profile files.
You can set certain scripts to be executed for every connection, allowing you to create a consistent environment across all remote systems.

As of now, there is only one set of scripts for enabling starship in your shell connections as a proof of concept.
However, you can contribute custom scripts [here](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/tree/master/ext/base/src/main/java/io/xpipe/ext/base/script/PredefinedScriptStore.java) and [here](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/tree/master/ext/base/src/main/resources/io/xpipe/ext/base/resources/scripts).

### Connection states

The second big change is a rework of the state system.
This merges the process of validating/refreshing with the process of establishing a connection, allowing for a much faster creation and launch of new connections.
It also enables a custom display and instant updates of the information displayed for a connection.
You will definitely notice this change when you connect to a system.

### Colors

For organization purposes when many connections are opened in the file base and terminals at the same time, you can now assign colors to connections.
These colors will be shown to identify tabs both within and outside XPipe for example in terminals.

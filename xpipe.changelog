## New professional features

- Add ability to open files and directories in VSCode SSH remote environment in file browser
- Added support for fully offline licenses. You can obtain them via email request
  in case you're running it on a system without internet connectivity or restricted proxy settings

## Additions

- You can now add SSH connections from arbitrary OpenSSH config files under `Add remote host` -> `SSH Config`
- Add a self test functionality on startup to handle cases where the local shell could not be initialized correctly 

## Changes

- The SSH config importer now supports include statements. Included files are automatically resolved and joined
- Improve performance mode appearance setting gains by removing more styling
- Change layout of connection names and status to better handle very long
  connection names across all window sizes
- Make any connection quickly renameable in the edit window without verifying whether we can actually connect
- Allow for creation of multiple connections with the same name

## Fixes

- Fix some zsh shells not properly setting up the PATH
- Fix git vault repository throwing initialization errors when shared with multiple Windows user permissions
- Fix copying and pasting a file into the same directory returning an error
- Fix connections being accidentally listed under scripts category
  if they were added while scripts category was selected

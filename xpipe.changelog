### New professional features

- Add ability to open files and directories in VSCode SSH remote environment in file browser

### Other changes

- Optimize terminal launching performance. When no scripts, environment, or custom title/color are enabled for a connection,
  it will now be instantly launched in a terminal without verifying the connection first.
  This will speed up the process but will move any occurring errors into the terminal window.
  It also fixes any login banners not being shown.
- Improve error messages when an additional password was requested by the connection
  when none was provided instead of just showing permission denied
- Make SSH connection starting from a WSL environment use the native Windows key helper for FIDO2 keys
- Automatically focus text field when showing askpass window
- Fix connection state not being preserved when being added the first time

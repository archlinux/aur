## Changes

- Add support to create customized SSH connections using arbitrary options.
  This can be done using the SSH config format but without having to create an actual file.
- Unify all SSH connection types to support the same functionality.
  I.e. you can now use SSH config connections to set up SSH tunnels as well.
- Properly detect when an active connection has unexpectedly reset during a file browser session.
  It will now be automatically restarted when any action is performed and fails.
- Rework connection creation menu layout to give a better overview
- Make the connection timeout value in the settings properly apply to ssh connections as well.
  This should help with SSH connections that take a long time to connect.
- Include pre-rasterized images for various sizes to reduce the render load at runtime
- Implement various performance improvements
- Rework some UI elements to better work with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Add unsupported shell notice when restricted bash is detected
- The daemon now properly reports any startup failure causes when started from the CLI via `xpipe open`
- The automatic updater will now ask for a confirmation in the terminal before proceeding to install
- Regularly clean logs directory to free up older log files

## Fixes

- Fix connections to pfSense systems not working (This time properly)
- Fix NullPointerException when a Linux system did not provide any release name

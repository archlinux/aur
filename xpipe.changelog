## Changes in 1.7.0

### Scripts

Have you ever set up all kinds of shell integrations and neat profile scripts to create your perfect local shell environment just as you want, but then realized that you can't apply it easily as well to your remote shell connections without copying profiles and installing the required packages everywhere?

As XPipe 1.7 comes with a new scripting system, you now can take your environment everywhere.
The idea is to create modular and reusable init scripts in XPipe that will be run on login but are independent of your profile files.
You can set certain scripts to be executed for every connection, allowing you to create a consistent environment across all remote systems.

As of now, there is only one set of scripts for enabling starship in your shell connections as a proof of concept.
However, you can contribute custom scripts [here](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/tree/master/ext/base/src/main/java/io/xpipe/ext/base/script/PredefinedScriptStore.java) and [here](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe/tree/master/ext/base/src/main/resources/io/xpipe/ext/base/resources/scripts).

### States

The second big change is a rework of the state system.
This merges the process of validating/refreshing with the process of establishing a connection, allowing for a much faster creation and launch of new connections.
It also enables a custom display and instant updates of the information displayed for a connection.

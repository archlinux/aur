      Full License Text

This license is effective on all sales and downloads made on and after
the 23rd of May 2018. This license is an agreement between *You* and
*Creative Fabrica B.V.*. When purchasing an item (not using a
subscription and excluding CF Premium items
<https://www.creativefabrica.com/cf-premium-license/>), You will receive
the rights to use the item(s) as defined in this license. *Permitted Usage*

  * Products can be used to create *unlimited projects* and/or products
    (both physical & digital) for personal and commercial use.
  * Fonts can be used to create quotes, texts, names, templates or may
    be incorporated in designs as much as you'd like.
  * You are allowed to *create digital end products* that you sell. In
    all cases, the product that you create must have distinctive new
    features that will create a entirely new product that won't compete
    with the original product. Combining multiple downloads into 1
    product is not enough. E.g. If you download flowers to create a
    floral wedding template, you can sell that flattened template. If
    you download a flower and create a card with just that flower
    without making significant modifications to the original product,
    this is prohibited.
  * Products can be used for Print on Demand (POD). Depending if the
    products is *Basic POD* or *Full POD*, the allowed usage differs.
    Basic POD will require alteration to products so it does not compete
    with the original product. Full POD allows you to use products
    without alteration.
  * Embroidery designs and fonts can be stitched out on a physical
    product only. The physical end product can be sold commercially,
    worldwide and in perpetuity; or can be shared without charge. It’s
    not allowed to sell or giveaway the digital Embroidery file with or
    without modifications.
  * This license is valid perpetually.
  * This license is valid worldwide
  * No attribution is required

*Prohibited Usage* The description in this license covers most
scenarios. However, it can happen that a scenario is not covered. In
case you are unclear if the product can be used for your intended use,
you agree to contact us at hi@creativefabrica.com before you start using
the product. This license may be updated over time with more use cases.
In case these use cases don't actually change the permitted use of the
items and is for clarification purposes only, you will not be notified.

  * Font files cannot be transferred to 3rd parties (e.g. clients,
    partners, customers). In case the 3rd party needs to receive the
    actual font file, a separate license needs to be purchased.
  * It is prohibited to convert numbers & letters in fonts to individual
    or grouped files and sell those numbers & letters as a set or as
    individual items.
  * It is prohibited to convert fonts into embroidery fonts and sell
    those fonts as your own product. You are allowed to convert fonts
    into embroidery fonts to create your own embroidery products.
  * You are never allowed to resell, share, re-distribute or otherwise
    transfer items downloaded to other 3rd parties.
  * Fonts should be used as a design element. You are allowed to use
    fonts as the main or only design element (e.g. creating a quote
    design using a font and sell the SVG file as an end-product).
  * You are allowed to create Digital End Products that you sell. In all
    cases, the product that you create must have distinctive new
    features that will create an entirely new product that won't compete
    with the original product. Combining multiple downloads into one
    product is not enough. The exception to this rule are full POD
    items. E.g. If you download flowers to create a floral wedding
    template, you can sell that template. If you download a flower and
    create a card with just that flower without making significant
    modifications to the original product, this is prohibited.
  * Digital End Products need to be flattened at all times, disabling
    customers/users from extracting the original design. E.g. using a
    flower to create a floral wedding template is allowed, as long as
    the user cannot extract the original flower image from the file you
    create.
  * Graphics and patterns cannot be used as a library inside another
    tool, platform or application. For example, if you are developing a
    tool that allows users to create mails (e.g. Mailchimp), you cannot
    embed the products that you downloaded as a resource for these
    templates, e.g. letting users picking their own mail background.
  * Embroidery designs and fonts cannot be sold as a digital end
    product. It’s not allowed to re-distribute the digital file in any
    way, with or without modifications.
  * Embroidery designs and embroidery fonts cannot be used for any type
    of POD.
  * Items or end products cannot be registered as a trademark in any
    territory. This license gives you non-exclusive rights. Other users
    can download and use the products as well, so you cannot claim sole
    ownership.

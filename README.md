scala-cli [![AUR Version](https://img.shields.io/aur/version/scala-cli)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scala-cli) ![AUR Maintainer](https://img.shields.io/aur/maintainer/scala-cli)
===========
This is an _unofficial_ AUR package for [scala-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/scala-cli).

**NOTE**: These changes are not published to the AUR yet. The old maintainer seems to have abandoned the package so I have put in an orphan request. However the orphan request has not yet been accepted as of this writing.

This package is in no way endorsed by upstream, so make sure you can distinguish between their bugs and ours ;)

This package has been mirrored to Github: <https://github.com/Techcable/aur-scala-cli>.

PRs and issues are welcome.

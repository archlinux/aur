This is a fork of a fork. 

The original project is located at https://github.com/JoyIfBam5/plantumlqeditor.git
The original fork with fixes is located at https://github.com/borco/plantumlqeditor.git

I added my own set of fixes to my personal fork of these repositories.

Changes;
- Added some fixes to allow the programm to compile. Removed deprecated QT code.
- Added code to treat '/usr/bin/plantuml' as a wrapper script, but calling
  java if the plantuml path ends with '.jar'

More fixes will be added to allow usage with current Arch/Manjaro releases.

# Installation instructions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Simply download the file "pytimer.py" and run it through the terminal.
    </li>
    <li>
      There is also an installer script for linux and MacOS that will try to put the file into your /usr/bin/ directory along with an executable script that makes it available as a command.
      Windows installer unsupported, but I might make it to learn how to make one.
      If you opt for the script, dont run it as super user (i.e. runnign "sudo pytimer-install.sh"), becuase then the script won't be able to install the files into the proper directories.

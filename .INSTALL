  In order to get the game running the vm.max_map_count kernel
  parameter needs to be increased, because otherwise the game will
  freeze while loading the main menu or after playing for a couple
  of minutes.  1024*1024 seems to work reliably.

  Temporarily set this value by running the command:
     sudo systemctl -w vm.max_map_count=1048576

  Or permanently apply this change with the command:
     echo 'vm.max_map_count=1048576' | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/vm.max_map_count.conf

# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Hunk are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.15.3] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Added release benchmark snapshots and a release workflow gate that blocks publishing when committed benchmark results show material performance regressions, with auditable accepted-regression records for intentional release tradeoffs.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows launches from Cygwin, Git Bash, and WSL-style VCS paths by normalizing Unix-style repo roots before reusing them as subprocess working directories or filesystem roots.
- Fixed release staging so benchmark comparison artifacts are not mistaken for platform binary artifacts.
- Reduced hunk-navigation latency and memory growth on large reviews by keeping diff geometry memoized when the selected hunk changes.
- Reduced scroll and hunk-navigation latency on large reviews by avoiding repeated separator measurement and preserving memoized offscreen/visible diff rows across viewport updates.
- Reduced main diff pane rendering work on large reviews by virtualizing offscreen file sections behind exact-height spacers.
- Reduced sidebar rendering work on many-file reviews by virtualizing offscreen file rows behind exact-height spacers.

## [0.15.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added

### Changed

- Coalesced scroll-position React updates into a single per-frame read and shifted background syntax highlighting from microtasks to timers, so rapid wheel or held-arrow scrolling no longer produces visible jank from per-delta state updates or per-file highlight work starving input and render callbacks.

### Fixed

- Honored `--transparent-bg` and `transparent_background` in static pager output, so captured pager hosts like LazyGit let translucent terminal backgrounds through on context lines, gutters, and hunk headers while added/removed rows keep their tinted backgrounds.
- Kept menu dropdowns and the help dialog on the base theme in transparent-background mode so popups remain readable over translucent terminals.
- Resolved `hunk session ... --repo <path>` selectors to the containing repo root before matching, so `--repo .` (and any path inside the tree) targets the live session from a subdirectory instead of reporting no match.

## [0.15.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- Restored the `e` keyboard shortcut and menu hint for opening the selected file in `$EDITOR`.
- Added timeouts to `hunk session *` daemon capability and API calls so unresponsive daemons fail instead of hanging indefinitely.
- Updated OpenTUI so light and dark theme backgrounds render without the native renderer's color shift.
- Prevented Git watch polling from taking optional index locks while discovering untracked files.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added

- Show the newly selected theme in the footer status bar when switching themes.
- Added Catppuccin Frappé and Macchiato as built-in themes, completing the four official Catppuccin flavors.
- Added a Zenburn built-in theme (`theme = "zenburn"`), a warm low-contrast dark palette inspired by Jani Nurminen's original Zenburn. It also works as a custom-theme `base`.
- Added a `--transparent-bg` flag and `transparent_background` config option for translucent terminal setups.
- Added Sapling VCS backend support for `hunk diff` and `hunk show`.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Preserved split diff alignment when horizontal scrolling starts inside a wide CJK or emoji character.
- Made diff syntax highlighting follow the active theme: keyword, function, number, and variable token colors now resolve to the configured theme's palette (including custom themes) in both light and dark, instead of passing through Pierre's built-in syntax colors.
- Expanded the diff window during rapid scrolling bursts so large reviews keep real rows mounted instead of falling back to blank placeholder regions.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Added local performance benchmarks for Hunk startup, loading, rendering, highlighting, navigation, memory, and optional competitor comparisons.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed npm installs by pinning `@pierre/diffs` to the version Hunk is tested with instead of allowing the broken `1.2.6` release.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Added Catppuccin Latte and Mocha as built-in themes.
- Added mouse-drag text selection in diff views that copies selected rows to the system clipboard via OSC 52. A `View > Copy decorations` toggle (or `copy_decorations` config) controls whether the clipboard includes diff rails, gutters, and file headers or only the changed code.
- Added inline expansion for collapsed unchanged file content. Click an unchanged-context row (`▾ N unchanged lines` when expandable, otherwise the static `··· N unchanged lines ···` form) or press `e` while a hunk is selected to reveal surrounding and trailing file lines without leaving the review. The affordance is shown only for input modes that have reachable source content (`hunk diff`, `show`, `stash show`, file-pair `diff` and `difftool`, untracked files); raw `hunk patch` input still renders as before. Failed and in-flight loads surface a one-line status ("Loading…", "Could not load N unchanged lines") on the gap row. Expanded context rows use the same syntax highlighting as the surrounding diff.
- Surfaced the agent author name in inline notes and the matching agent popover so multi-agent reviews are readable at a glance, with a fallback title when an annotation has no author.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Preserved Git log ANSI colors when `hunk pager` falls back to a plain-text terminal pager for non-diff output.
- Capped inline context expansion source reads so huge files cannot freeze or exhaust memory when expanding unchanged lines.
- Hardened plain-text pager startup so `PAGER` and `HUNK_TEXT_PAGER` shell metacharacters are passed as arguments instead of being evaluated implicitly.
- Hardened terminal rendering against control-sequence injection from diffs, file paths, notes, expanded context, copied selections, and pager fallback output.
- Fixed custom theme configuration so Catppuccin Latte and Mocha can be used as base themes.
- Fixed inline note draft shortcuts so copy chords such as Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Shift-C no longer trigger note actions.
- Fixed split diff alignment for wide CJK and emoji characters by measuring rendered text in terminal cells.
- Fixed Ctrl-S saving for inline notes when tmux sends CSI-u keyboard input.
- Stabilized hover backgrounds on wrapped diff rows so add-note affordances do not shift row layout.
- Restricted session reloads so daemon commands cannot read files outside the initial Hunk session root.
- Fixed static pager output so captured pager hosts honor configured custom themes.
- Made `hunk pager` pass non-diff text through in captured pager and dumb-terminal contexts instead of spawning `less`.
- Fixed the `e` editor shortcut when Hunk is launched from a repo subdirectory.
- Fixed VCS auto-detection so a Git repository nested under a parent Jujutsu workspace still uses Git mode by default.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- Hid the inline add-note affordance while scrolling and only show it after deliberate pointer movement, so it no longer flickers during review navigation.
- Hardened the local session daemon against browser-originated requests by validating Host and Origin headers and requiring JSON content types for API posts.
- Disabled the generic broker HTTP API by default so Hunk's supported session API is the only app-daemon command surface.
- Bounded session daemon memory by capping HTTP request body and websocket message sizes and rejecting session registrations with oversized file, hunk, patch, comment, or note payloads.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added an `e` shortcut to open the selected diff file in `$EDITOR`.
- Added `g` and `G` keyboard aliases for jump-to-top and jump-to-bottom review navigation.
- Added session-persistent user-authored inline notes with `c` to draft/save notes.
- Added `hunk session comment list --type <live|all|ai|agent|user>` so agents can read human-authored notes through the comment workflow.

### Changed

- Clarified inline note draft actions by labeling buttons as `Save (^S)` and `Cancel (Esc)`.

### Fixed

- Fixed draft note focus handling so app shortcuts resume after the note textarea blurs without discarding the draft.
- Preserved the resolved auto theme across `--watch` refreshes instead of falling back to the default dark theme.
- Fixed standalone release archive generation so staged npm package directories are not accidentally packaged as GitHub release assets.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- Included the bundled Hunk review skill in standalone prebuilt release archives so `hunk skill path` works after extracting a tarball or installing via Homebrew.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Added Homebrew tap release automation and Homebrew-aware startup update notices.
- Added lower-level `hunkdiff/opentui` primitives for embedding Hunk diff bodies, file headers, file navigation, and multi-file review streams in custom OpenTUI apps.
- Added row windowing for large single-file reviews to keep huge diffs responsive.
- Added Windows x64 prebuilt artifact publishing to the release workflow.
- Added native Windows support in the README, contributor guide, and local build/install scripts.
- Added Nix flake app outputs for `nix run`, a named `hunk` package output, and package validation.
- Added automatic light/dark theme detection from the terminal background when `theme = "auto"` is enabled.

### Changed

- Ported `build:npm`, `build:bin`, and `install:bin` from bash scripts to cross-platform Bun-runnable TypeScript so native Windows contributors no longer need Git Bash to build or install Hunk locally.

### Fixed

- Fixed the prebuilt npm package so the `hunkdiff/opentui` export and bundled type declarations are included.
- Fixed the npm package so `npx hunkdiff` and other package-name executable lookups resolve to the Hunk CLI.
- Made `hunk pager` emit static highlighted diff output for captured pager contexts like LazyGit, and pass diff input through unchanged when stdout is non-interactive.
- Fixed Ctrl-Z job-control suspend support so Hunk can suspend and resume cleanly from a terminal.
- Fixed Windows compatibility issues across paths, packaging, and tests.
- Fixed Ctrl-C in the live TUI so it exits through Hunk's full shutdown path instead of only destroying the renderer.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

### Changed

- Auto-detect Jujutsu checkouts for `hunk diff` and `hunk show`, while keeping explicit `vcs` config overrides.

### Fixed

- Fixed large tracked and untracked file handling so very large diffs render as skipped placeholders instead of slowing startup or overflowing the JavaScript call stack.
- Fixed Git patch parsing for `diff.noprefix=true` input so Hunk restores parser-safe `a/` and `b/` prefixes without mangling real paths.
- Fixed `hunk pager` parsing for Git diffs emitted with `diff.mnemonicPrefix=true` so file paths do not keep `i/`, `w/`, `c/`, `1/`, or `2/` side prefixes.
- Fixed review scrolling so viewport updates are coalesced and no longer risk a render loop.
- Fixed agent comment hunk ranges so context lines from hunk headers remain part of the target range.
- Fixed untracked-file reviews in repositories with external diff tools configured by passing `--no-ext-diff`.
- Fixed diff geometry for hunks with multiple agent notes so offscreen notes no longer skew scrolling measurements.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added `vcs = "jj"` support, enabling `hunk diff [revset]` and `hunk show [revset]`.
- Added a pager-mode sidebar file tree that can be revealed with the existing `s` shortcut while keeping pager chrome hidden by default.

### Changed

### Fixed

- Fixed `git log -p` and multi-commit `git show -p` inputs so patch parsing ignores commit metadata instead of emitting Pierre parser warnings.
- Fixed cross-file hunk navigation so near-boundary jumps keep the selected file pinned and backward jumps reveal the target hunk instead of the file top.
- Fixed the View menu sidebar checkmark so it follows whether the responsive layout is actually rendering the sidebar.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added agent comment counts in the sidebar so review-heavy files stand out at a glance.
- Added `hunk daemon serve` as the standard daemon entrypoint and published reusable session-broker packages plus an OpenTUI diff component for integrators.

### Changed

- Included untracked files when `hunk diff <ref>` still compares against the live working tree, while keeping explicit revset diffs commit-to-commit only.

### Fixed

- Enabled mouse scrolling in pager mode.
- Balanced Pierre word-level highlights so split-view inline changes stay visible without overpowering the surrounding diff row.
- Smoothed mouse-wheel review scrolling so small diffs stay precise while sustained wheel gestures still speed up.
- Fixed Shift+mouse-wheel horizontal scrolling so it no longer leaks a one-line vertical scroll in some terminals.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added a Modem sponsor block to the README.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added `hunk skill path` to print the bundled Hunk review skill path for direct loading or symlinking in coding agents.

### Changed

- Show a one-time startup notice after version changes that points users with copied agent skills to `hunk skill path`.

### Fixed

- Restored execute permissions for packaged prebuilt binaries so `npm install -g hunkdiff` works on root-owned installs without `spawnSync … EACCES` failures.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-13

# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Hunk are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added agent comment counts in the sidebar so review-heavy files stand out at a glance.
- Added `hunk daemon serve` as the standard daemon entrypoint and published reusable session-broker packages plus an OpenTUI diff component for integrators.

### Changed

- Included untracked files when `hunk diff <ref>` still compares against the live working tree, while keeping explicit revset diffs commit-to-commit only.

### Fixed

- Enabled mouse scrolling in pager mode.
- Balanced Pierre word-level highlights so split-view inline changes stay visible without overpowering the surrounding diff row.
- Smoothed mouse-wheel review scrolling so small diffs stay precise while sustained wheel gestures still speed up.
- Fixed Shift+mouse-wheel horizontal scrolling so it no longer leaks a one-line vertical scroll in some terminals.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added a Modem sponsor block to the README.

### Changed

### Fixed

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- Added `hunk skill path` to print the bundled Hunk review skill path for direct loading or symlinking in coding agents.

### Changed

- Show a one-time startup notice after version changes that points users with copied agent skills to `hunk skill path`.

### Fixed

- Restored execute permissions for packaged prebuilt binaries so `npm install -g hunkdiff` works on root-owned installs without `spawnSync … EACCES` failures.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed

- Normalized rename-only diff paths so pure renames keep one clean `old/path -> new/path` header in the review UI ([#194](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/pull/194)).
- Stripped Pierre's empty-line newline placeholder spans so blank additions and deletions keep stable line numbers and diff row backgrounds ([#201](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/pull/201)).

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Fixed a bottom-edge scrolling regression where short last files could snap back and make upward navigation feel stuck near the end of the review stream ([#196](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/pull/196)).

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed

- Preserved viewport position when switching layouts ([#185](https://github.com/modem-dev/hunk/pull/185)).

# WARNING: This script assumes being run inside XDG compliant session,
# which means D-Bus session instance is expected to be correctly set up
# prior to this script starting. If that is not true, things may break!

# Best to reap any existing daemons and only then try to start a new set.

# The so called pipewire-pulse daemon used for PulseAudio compatibility.
# Commenting this out will stop the PA proxying daemon from starting,
# however ALSA (with pipewire-alsa), JACK (with jack-sdk) and PW API using
# clients will still have access to audio and may end up clashing with
# non-PW apps over HW control (most notably, /usr/bin/pulseaudio daemon).

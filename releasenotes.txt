## Bug Fixes
- crash when enabling 'Others' component type at startup in VR.
- sizing of datasets scroll pane with expand/collapse groups is incorrect in some instances.
- add free space check before downloads, and clean up properly after a failed extraction operation. Fixes [#744](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/744).
- auto-scroll to target when cycling through UI elements with gamepad left stick. Selection and action with gamepad in dataset manager window.
- zero-length keyframed path crashes the 'normalize times' action. Fixes [#741](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/741).
- add missing, untranslated strings to I18N files. Fixes [#740](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/740).
- start and dataset manager buttons do not scale horizontally with content.
- ascending node parameter in rotation component does not apply correctly. Bump source version to 3.5.7, for new data is needed.
- recursive tile lookup in sparse virtual textures module does not work correctly.
- prevent SVT level overflows, and prompt for restart when tile cache size is modified in preferences.

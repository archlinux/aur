# Gaia Sky 3.5.4-1

## Bug Fixes
- move action stuttering on some systems due to no input changes since last sync.
- application title in loading screen squashes the logo.

## Build System
- set bundled JRE version to 17 instead of 20; seemingly, there are non-negligible performance issues with the JRE 20 on some configurations.

# Gaia Sky 3.5.4

## Features
- add square recursive grid style, additionally to the existing circular concentric rings.
- add diagonal lines at 30 and 60 degrees to the circular recursive grid.
- redesign time pane layout and widgets (warp slider, play/pause, information boxes, etc.) in controls window.
- upgrade internal version numbering to include a sequence number within the revision (major.minor.revision-sequence). It should be backwards compatible, but starting with this version, internal version numbers have at least 7 digits instead of 5.
- bump source version number.
- refactor separator UI elements.
- redesign loading screen to follow welcome screen style.

# Gaia Sky 3.3.2

## Bug Fixes
- stop intercepting data location in paths, implementation did not work for Windows when the original path contained '*', and it was useless anyway, as we always use fully-defined paths.
- avoid expanding dataset file paths in dataset manager to prevent horizontal overflow.

## Features
- improve drag rotation behaviour when very close to objects.

# Gaia Sky 3.6.0

## Features
- add support for OptFlowCam (Piotrowski 2024) method to convert keyframes into camera path files. Gaia Sky calls the local python3 interpreter to process the keyframe files, so a local python3 installation (with numpy) needs to be in place for it to work.
- add support for B-splines, additionally to Catmull-Rom splines, as a method for interpolating positions between keyframes.
- reorganize keyframes window layout for better use of space.
- add different durations for the transitions in position and orientation in the API call.
- add smooth interpolation methods to `cameraTransition()` calls. The new methods can use either a logistic sigmoid or a logit function. Smoothing factor is configurable via a parameter.
- add 'textureAttribute' to particle sets, so that textures are selected with respect to the value of an attribute.
- use local dataset descriptors to construct catalog infos, when they are not explicitly set.
- enable local data information in the '+ info' window. This displays the local data on an object. In particle and star groups, the extra attributes are also offered.
- enable extra arguments of type string for star and particle sets.
- rename 'star systems' group to 'exoplanets \& extrasolar systems'. Add icons to group title in dataset manager.
- add support for multiple key sets bound to actions in hotkey tooltip.
- keyframes and camera path file saving no longer overwrites existing files. Instead, it generates a new unique file name based on the given one.
- support comma- as well as whitespace-separated values for camera and keyframes files. Default to comma-separated values for writing.
- add API call to get the window coordinates of an object, in pixels.
- add API calls to do camera transitions only in position and orientation.
- add time transition API call and test script.

## Bug Fixes
- check leap years in date dialog.
- prevent NaNs in some camera operations.
- clean up test scripts a bit.
- `startRecordingCameraPath(String filename)` does not use the filename correctly.

## Build System
- update dependency library versions.

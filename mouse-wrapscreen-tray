#
# This script can be configured using the following environment variables:
#
#  DSMUMWST_CNF_RUNNING
#  DSMUMWST_CNF_STOPPED
#
#     Full paths to the images used in the system tray if the process is running or stopped,
#     respectively. All image formats supported by QIcon may be used. The default paths are
#     /usr/share/dualscreen-mouse-utils/running.svg and …/stopped.svg.
#
#  DSMUMWST_CNF_COMMAND
#
#     The command to execute to start the process. Either a full path or located somewhere in
#     $PATH. Command line parameters may be included, the command will be split on whitespace
#     using shlex.split() (shell-style escapes and quoting is supported, see shlex.split()).
#     The default is "mouse-wrapscreen".
#
#  DSMUMWST_CNF_PROCESS
#
#     The process name to look for when checking if the process is running. Usually, but not
#     always, the name of the executable. The default is "mouse-wrapscreen".
#
#  DSMUMWST_CNF_OWNNAME
#
#     This name will be set for the script's own process, it replaces the generic "python"
#     name. The name must be unique. When $DSMUMWST_CNF_COMMAND is started or stopped the
#     name will be used to located other running instances of this script and signal them to
#     update their icons. Names longer than 15 bytes will be truncated! The default name is
#     "dsmumwstray".
#
#  DSMUMWST_CNF_DELAYMS
#
#     Signal handlers will not be run when Qt is doing nothing, waiting for events. A timer
#     will be created to generate an event every $DSMUMWST_CNF_DEALYMS milliseconds. Updates
#     of the tray icons of other running instances will take up to this time. The default is
#     "500" (half a second). This value may be set to "0" to disable the timer.
#
# Note that there is no error checking!
#
# Sending a SIGUSR1 signal to this script will change the status icon to the "running" icon,
# SIGUSR2 will change the icon to the "stopped" icon.

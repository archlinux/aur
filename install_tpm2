This hook allows for an encrypted root device to use a key sealed by a
TPM 2.0. It should be placed immediately before the 'encrypt' hook. After
generating a TPM-sealed key, both 'tpmkey' and 'tpmpcr' should be
specified on the kernel command line.

'tpmkey' has several formats:

  tpmkey=[device]:[path]:[handle]
  tpmkey=[device]:[publicpath]:[privatepath]:[handle]
  tpmkey=nvram:[index]
  tpmkey=nvram:[index]:[offset]:[size]

Where [device] represents the raw block device on which the key exists,
[path] is the absolute base path of the keyfiles within the device, and
[handle] is the TPM handle of the key's parent object. If only [path] is
specified, '.pub' and '.priv' will be appended to the path to locate the
public and private files, respectively. The absolute [publicpath] and
[privatepath] can be specified separately if needed.

Setting [device] to 'nvram' indicates that the key is stored in TPM NVRAM.
In this case [index] is the NVRAM area index, [offset] is the offset of
the key in bytes and [size] is the size of the key in bytes.

'tpmpcr' should hold the TPM2 PCR bank specification that will unlock the
sealed key. Multiple specs can be separated by a '|' and key decryption
will be attempted with each set of banks.

The first PCR bank spec may be used to indicate a PCR to extend after
unsealing the key.

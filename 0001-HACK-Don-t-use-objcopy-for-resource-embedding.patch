Subject: [PATCH] HACK: Don't use objcopy for resource embedding

The build attempts to use objcopy to link in the resource data, but
loses the code protection flags `IBT` and `SHSTK` in the process.

If we don't let it do that, it generates a C string literal for the data
instead. This is a bit slower, but doesn't mess with the flags.

Hint: If you firejail installed, you can also launch it as "firejail ghostery".
If you want to always use firejail, you can define a symbolic link:

$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/firejail /usr/local/bin/ghostery

Now, running "ghostery" will have the same effect as:

$ /usr/bin/firejail /usr/bin/ghostery

EOF
}

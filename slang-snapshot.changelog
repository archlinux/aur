Changes since 2.3.3
1. src/slang.c: Use ptrdiff_t instead of long for the intrinsic
   function prototypes.  This is especially important for LLP64
   systems such as MS windows.
2. src/slw32tty.c: The console mode was not getting reset by the
   SLang_reset_tty function on windows systems
3. src/_slint.h: On windows sytems, use %lld and %llu for long long
   integer formats
4. mkfiles/m32init.bat: Copy config file to module and slsh
   subdirectories (windows-specific)
5. src/slposio.c: Added a window-specific tweak so that dup2 returns
   the duped file descriptor.  Also updated the regresssion tests
   (window-specific).
6. src/slvideo.c: On windows, make calls to SetConsoleScreenBufferSize
   and SetConsoleWindowInfo after calling CreateConsoleScreenBuffer so
   that the newly created console will have the correct size.  Also
   INSTALL.pc was updated (windows-specific)
7. mkfiles/makefile.m32: Added install1 target to work with versions
   of mingw make that cannot process the install target.  Previously
   this required editing the makefile (windows specific)
8. src/sltime.c: check for NULL return value from the ctime function
9. src/slang.ver: Removed the undefined symbol SLang_Rline_Quit,
   which was causing a link error on Gentoo Linux (Michal Rostecki)
10. src/*.h: Updated the unicode tables from version 10.0.0 to 15.1.0
11. lib/timestamp.sl: The test for a leap year assumed a 1-based
    month, not 0 based, causing it to fail

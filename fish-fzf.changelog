Breaking change

  Search Directory's and Search Variable's custom fzf opts variables (used to
  pass fzf options to specific commands) were renamed in v9.5. Now the old,
  deprecated names have been completely removed (615ce65):

  * Search Directory: if you use fzf_dir_opts, switch to fzf_directory_opts
  * Search Variables: if you use fzf_shell_vars_opts, switch to fzf_variables_opts

Search History

  Slightly improve performance, add test and comments (82dd51e).

[git log][git status] Integrate preview with diff highlighters

  If fzf_diff_highlighter is set, fzf.fish will pipe git diff-like output
  through its value. This enables integration with delta, diff-so-fancy,
  diff-highlighter, or https://github.com/walles/riff

[history][git log] Use fzf history scoring scheme

  The history scoring scheme is much better suited for ranking input in which
  chronological order is important. The previous scheme was commonly causing
  commands and commits from months ago to overtake those more recent. This
  issue is now mostly alleviated.

# RTSP parameters

# Disable support for the RTSP protocol.
rtspDisable: no
# List of enabled RTSP transport protocols.
# UDP is the most performant, but doesn't work when there's a NAT/firewall between
# server and clients, and doesn't support encryption.
# UDP-multicast allows to save bandwidth when clients are all in the same LAN.
# TCP is the most versatile, and does support encryption.
# The handshake is always performed with TCP.
protocols: [udp, multicast, tcp]
# Encrypt handshake and TCP streams with TLS (RTSPS).
# Available values are "no", "strict", "optional".
encryption: "no"
# Address of the TCP/RTSP listener. This is needed only when encryption is "no" or "optional".
rtspAddress: :8554
# Address of the TCP/TLS/RTSPS listener. This is needed only when encryption is "strict" or "optional".
rtspsAddress: :8322
# Address of the UDP/RTP listener. This is needed only when "udp" is in protocols.
rtpAddress: :8000
# Address of the UDP/RTCP listener. This is needed only when "udp" is in protocols.
rtcpAddress: :8001
# IP range of all UDP-multicast listeners. This is needed only when "multicast" is in protocols.
multicastIPRange: 224.1.0.0/16
# Port of all UDP-multicast/RTP listeners. This is needed only when "multicast" is in protocols.

# Path to the server key. This is needed only when encryption is "strict" or "optional".

# HLS parameters

# Disable support for the HLS protocol.
hlsDisable: no
# Address of the HLS listener.
hlsAddress: :8888
# By default, HLS is generated only when requested by a user.
# This option allows to generate it always, avoiding the delay between request and generation.
hlsAlwaysRemux: no
# Variant of the HLS protocol to use. Available options are:
# * mpegts - uses MPEG-TS segments, for maximum compatibility.
# * fmp4 - uses fragmented MP4 segments, more efficient.
# * lowLatency - uses Low-Latency HLS.
hlsVariant: mpegts
# Number of HLS segments to keep on the server.
# Segments allow to seek through the stream.
# Their number doesn't influence latency.
hlsSegmentCount: 7
# Minimum duration of each segment.
# A player usually puts 3 segments in a buffer before reproducing the stream.
# The final segment duration is also influenced by the interval between IDR frames,
# since the server changes the duration in order to include at least one IDR frame
# in each segment.
hlsSegmentDuration: 1s
# Minimum duration of each part.
# A player usually puts 3 parts in a buffer before reproducing the stream.
# Parts are used in Low-Latency HLS in place of segments.
# Part duration is influenced by the distance between video/audio samples
# and is adjusted in order to produce segments with a similar duration.
hlsPartDuration: 200ms
# Maximum size of each segment.
# This prevents RAM exhaustion.
hlsSegmentMaxSize: 50M
# Value of the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header provided in every HTTP response.
# This allows to play the HLS stream from an external website.
hlsAllowOrigin: '*'
# Enable TLS/HTTPS on the HLS server.
# This is required for Low-Latency HLS.
hlsEncryption: no
# Path to the server key. This is needed only when encryption is yes.
# This can be generated with:
# openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
# openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 3650

# Path parameters

# These settings are path-dependent, and the map key is the name of the path.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix.
# For example, "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2".
# For example, "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
# The settings under the path "all" are applied to all paths that do not match
# another entry.

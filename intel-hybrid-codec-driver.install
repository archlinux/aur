## NOTE ##

Due to a bug this package _might_ no longer provides support for using vaapi via X11.
Apps configured to use vaapi in this way (e.g. VLC, MPV) should be changed to
use vaapi via DRM.

The libva-intel-driver package isn't compiled with support for loading this driver
so in order to use this driver's features with non hybrid codecs either
recompile libva-intel-driver with the --enable-hybrid-codec or install
the libva-intel-driver-hybrid package from the AUR

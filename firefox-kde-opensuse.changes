  A combination of these actually resulted in the OOM condition.
  It's even possible to add basic debugging info while keeping

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sun Jul  2 16:00:53 UTC 2023 - Wolfgang Rosenauer <wr@rosenauer.org>

- Mozilla Firefox 115.0
  * Support for importing payment methods saved in Chrome-based browser
  * Hardware video decoding is now enabled for Intel GPUs on Linux
  * The Tab Manager dropdown now features close buttons, so tabs
    can be closed more quickly
  * Streamlined the user interface for importing data in from other browsers
  * Users without platform support for H264 video decoding can now
    fallback to Cisco's OpenH264 plugin for playback.
  * Undo and redo are now available in Password fields
  * Changed: On Linux, middle clicks on the new tab button will
    now open the xclipboard contents in the new tab. If the
    xclipboard content is a URL then that URL is opened, any
    other text is opened with your default search provider.
  * Changed: For users with a Firefox Colorways built-in theme,
    the theme will be automatically migrated to the same theme
    hosted on addons.mozilla.org for Firefox profiles that have
    disabled add-ons auto-updates. This will allow users to keep
    their Colorways theme when they are later removed from
    Firefox installer files.
  * Changed: Certain Firefox users may come across a message in
    the extensions panel indicating that their add-ons are not
    allowed on the site currently open. We have introduced a new
    back-end feature to only allow some extensions monitored by
    Mozilla to run on specific websites for various reasons,
    including security concerns.
  * HTML5: The builtin editor now behaves similarly to other
    browsers with `contenteditable` and `designMode` when
    splitting a node, e.g. typing Enter to split a paragraph, and
    also when joining two nodes, e.g. typing Backspace at the
    start of a paragraph to join the paragraph and the previous
    one.
    When a node is split, the builtin editor creates a new node
    after the original one instead of before, i.e. creates the
    right node instead of the left node.
    Similarly, when two nodes are joined, the builtin editor
    deletes the latter node and moves its children to the end of
    the preceding node instead of deleting the former node and
    moving its child to the start of the following node.
  * HTML5: WebRTC application developers can now specify a target
    in milliseconds of media for the jitter buffer to hold.
    Altering the target value allows applications to control the
    tradeoff between playout delay and the risk of running out of
    audio or video frames due to network jitter.
  * HTML5: Change array by copy provides additional methods on
    `Array.prototype` and `TypedArray.prototype` to enable
    changes on the array by returning a new copy of it with the
    change.
  * HTML5: The animation-composition property is now supported,
    allowing a declarative way to define the composite operation
    used when multiple animations affect the same property
    simultaneously.
  * HTML5: Added the URL.canParse() function to allow easy and
    fast checking if URLs are valid and parseable.
  * HTML5: IndexedDB is now also supported in private browsing
    without memory limits thanks to encrypted storage on disk.
    The temporary keys to decrypt the information are hold in RAM
    only and all stored information is purged at the normal end
    of a private browsing session from disk.
  * HTML5: Supports conditions are now supported in CSS import
    rules @import supports(...)
  * Developer: In web development, we rely on third-party
    libraries which you may not be interested in while debugging.
    These can be ignored. Ignoring them means that breakpoints
    will not get hit and they are skipped during stepping.
    You can now choose to **Hide ignore-listed sources** in the

    Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 114
  * New: Added UI to manage the DNS over HTTPS exception list.
    (bmo#1596847)
  * New: Bookmarks can now be searched from the Bookmarks menu.
    The Bookmarks menu is accessible by adding the *Bookmarks
    menu* button to the toolbar. (bmo#1736937)
  * New: Restrict searches to your local browsing history by
    selecting *Search history* from the History, Library or
    Application menu buttons. (bmo#1736939)
  * New: Mac users can now capture video from their cameras in
    all supported native resolutions. This enables resolutions
    higher than 1280x720. (bmo#1806604)
  * New: It is now possible to reorder the extensions listed in
    the extensions panel. (bmo#1805924)
  * New: Users on macOS, Linux, and Windows 7 can now use FIDO2 /
    WebAuthn authenticators over USB. Some advanced features,
    such as fully passwordless logins, require a PIN to be set on
    the authenticator. (bmo#1814487)
  * New: Pocket Recommended content can now be seen in France,
    Italy, and Spain. (bmo#None)
  * Changed: DNS over HTTPS settings are now part of  the
    *Privacy & Security* section of the *Settings* page and allow
    the user to choose from all the supported modes.
    (bmo#1610741)
  * HTML5: DOM: Added support for ES Modules on DedicatedWorker
    and SharedWorker
  * HTML5: WebTransport is now enabled by default and will be
    going to release with 114. As the original Explainer  notes,
    it enables multiple use-cases that are hard or impossible to
    handle without it, especially for Gaming and live streaming.
    It covers cases that are problematic for alternative
    mechanisms, such as WebSockets.
    Built on top of HTTP3 (HTTP2 support will be coming later).
    The current implementation in Firefox is passing 505 out of
    565 Web-Platform Tests.
  * HTML5: CSS: The `infinity` and `NaN` constants are now
    supported inside the `calc()` function. (bmo#1830759)
  * Developer: The *Copy as cURL* feature, available in the
    Network panel, has been enhanced. It now supports the
    -`-compressed` argument. (bmo#1776120)
  * Developer: The Accessibility Inspector has been improved to
    accurately recognize all the ARIA roles like `banner`,
    `main`, `navigation`, and `contentinfo`, etc. This
    enhancement is particularly beneficial for web developers
    working with ARIA roles to improve web accessibility.
    (bmo#1572512)
  * Developer: Firefox now provides support for the CSS Cascading
    Level 4 `supports()` syntax for `@import` rules. This allows
    for the importation of other stylesheets based on support-
    dependency. In addition, the Inspector panel now accurately
    displays the conditions at the top of the imported rule.

- Remove bashisms ("source" and "function" keywords) from
  mozilla.sh.in to ally with the #!/bin/sh shebang. If the end user
  has either dash-sh package or busybox-sh to handle Bourn Shell
  scripts rather than having bash-sh package, the script would
  fail. Using "." instead of "source" and "create_langpack_link()"
  function definition is enough to keep both sides sane,
  behavior-wise.

  adapt to more worker types, and lowers the time the package
  is stuck in "scheduling". raising memory above 8 to lower
  risk for LTO jobs to run OOM
- add hack to disable -Wl,--gc-section which avoids a binutils

-------------------------------------------------------------------

- disable ccache, this adds about 1 minute of build time and
  over 2 GB of disk space usage without benefit on OBS builds
- build with rust-simd like upstream does
- use -g1 for debuginfo generation as this is what upstream
  does as well and it saves ~ 2GB of writes
- use %limit on x86_64 to scale down to less capable workers
- disable install stripping so that debuginfo is useful
- use autopatch
- cleanup constraints to specify only jobs, physicalmemory
  and memoryperjob to be more flexible on which host to build
  on

- Update to the fourth Firefox 3.0 Beta (2.9.94):
  + Based upon the Gecko 1.9 Web rendering platform, which improves
    performance, stability, and rendering correctness; it also
    boasts a considerable simplification in its code
  + Security improvements:
    * One-click site info
    * Malware Protection
    * New Web Forgery Protection page
    * New SSL error pages
    * Add-ons and Plugin version check
    * Secure add-on updates
    * Effective top-level domain (eTLD) service to better restrict
      cookies and other restricted content to a single domain
    * Better protection against cross-site JSON data leaks
  + Usability improvements:
    * Easier password management
    * Simplified add-on installation
    * New Download Manager
    * Resumable downloading
    * Full page zoom
    * Podcasts and Videocasts can be associated with your media
      playback tools
    * Tab scrolling and quickmenu
    * Save what you were doing: Firefox will prompt users to save
      tabs on exit
    * Optimized Open in Tabs behavior
    * Location and Search bar size can now be customized with a
      simple resizer item
    * Text selection improvements
    * Find toolbar
    * Improved integration with Linux: Firefox's default icons,
      buttons, and menu styles now use the native GTK theme
  + Personalization improvements:
    * Star button: quickly add bookmarks from the location bar
      with a single click; a second click lets you file and tag them
    * Tags: associate keywords with your bookmarks to sort them
      by topic
    * Location bar & auto-complete
    * Smart Bookmarks Folder
    * Places Organizer: view, organize and search through all
      of your bookmarks, tags, and browsing history with multiple
      views and smart folders to store your frequent searches
    * Web-based protocol handlers
    * Download & Install Add-ons
    * Easy to use Download Actions
  + Improved platform for web developers:
    * New graphics and font handling: new graphics and text
      rendering architectures in Gecko 1.9 provides rendering
      improvements in CSS, SVG as well as improved display of
      fonts with ligatures and complex scripts
    * Color management: (set gfx.color_management.enabled on
      in about:config and restart the browser to enable.);
      Firefox can now adjust images with embedded color profiles
    * Offline support: enables web applications to provide
      offline functionality (website authors must add support
      for offline browsing to their site for this feature
      to be available to users)
  + Improved performance:
    * Speed: improvements to the JavaScript engine as well as
      profile guided optimizations have resulted in significant
      improvements in performance; compared to Firefox 2,
      web applications like Google Mail and Zoho Office run
      twice as fast in Firefox 3 Beta 4, and the popular
      SunSpider test from Apple shows improvements over
      previous releases
    * Memory usage: Several new technologies work together to
      reduce the amount of memory used by Firefox 3 Beta 4
      over a web browsing session;  memory cycles are broken
      and collected by an automated cycle collector, a new
      memory allocator reduces fragmentation, hundreds of leaks
      have been fixed, and caching strategies have been tuned
    * Reliability: A user's bookmarks, history, cookies, and
      preferences are now stored in a transactionally secure
      database format which will prevent data loss even if their
      system crashes
- This version depends upon the mozilla-xulrunner190 package
- Drop various stale packages, respin several that have been
  kept around, and add a few new ones.

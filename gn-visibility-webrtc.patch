Subject: [PATCH] Relax googletest gn config visibility for webrtc
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

An upcoming gn roll will start enforcing config visibility on
public_configs and all_dependent_configs. Normally, configs with
limited visibility have corresponding helper targets that push the
configs using public_configs and are propagated with public_deps.
However, webrtc prefers to avoid public_deps, and pushes the gtest
config using all_dependent_configs. This requires direct visibility,
so tweak gtest BUILD.gn to make things work.

Bug: gn:252, 1249254

RESTRICTIONS OF LIABILITY REGARDING CUSTOMERS IN GERMANY

Corel is liable for damages based on an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty or malice by Corel, its legal representatives or persons whom it uses to perform its obligations. Insofar as Corel is liable for malice pursuant to sentence 1, compensation for damages of commercial customers is limited to the foreseeable, typically arising damages.

Further, Corel is also liable for damages that are caused by simple negligence if the negligence concerns the breach of such contractual obligations the fulfillment of which is of particular importance to achieving the purpose of the contract and in which You may therefore regularly trust (cardinal obligation; Kardinalpflicht). In this case, liability is limited to the foreseeable, typically arising damages.

In addition, Corel has unlimited liability for damage to life, limb, and health for which it is responsible, which are caused by negligent or intentional breach of duty. Corel also assumes liability to the extent it has provided a guaranty as to quality or durability within the context of this guarantee.

Further contractual or statutory liability is – to the extent legally permitted – excluded without regard to the legal status of the claim asserted.

Where Corel’s liability is excluded or limited, this also applies to the personal liability of its employees, representatives and persons whom it uses to perform its obligations as well as Corel’s responsibility for their behavior.

U.S. GOVERNMENT-RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Software and any accompanying documentation are “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” under DFAR Section 227.7202 and FAR Section 12.212.

No term or provision in this EULA will be considered waived, and no breach excused, unless such waiver is in writing signed on behalf of the party against whom the waiver is asserted.

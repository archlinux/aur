EventSentry is a monitoring solution that runs on Windows 2000, Windows 2003 Server, WinXP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 that actively monitors your server's (or workstation's) event log, log files, system health and network. Configure EventSentry to notify you if important events matching your filter criteria occur or consolidate your event logs into one central location such as a central ODBC database. Through EventSentry, you can be actively notified in several ways when events take place including email, ASCII file, ODBC, Unix syslog, SNMP, network (net send), process, sound and desktop. EventSentry will also monitor performance, system services, disk space, (memory consumption of) processes and the addition/removal of applications and autorun registry entries.

This helps administrators save time, as they do not have to perform tasks that are included in AutoAdministrator anymore.

"Licensed Accounts" means the number of computers on which the Software may be installed. For such purposes, a workstation and a server shall each be treated as one computer.

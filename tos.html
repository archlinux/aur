<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship
    with https://www.termius.com website and Termius mobile application (the "Service") operated by Termius
    Corporation ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using our website and Termius
    mobile application (the "Service").</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and
    compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the
    Service.
</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree
    with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>
<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)").
    You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are
    set
    either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
    purchasing a
    Subscription.</p>
<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under
    the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Termius Corporation cancels it. You may cancel your
    Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Termius
    Corporation
    customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the
    payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Termius Corporation with accurate and complete billing
    information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method
    information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Termius Corporation to
    charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Termius Corporation will
    issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date,
    with
    the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
<h2>Free Trial</h2>
<p>Termius Corporation may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free
    trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
<p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the
    Free Trial.</p>
<p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you
    will not be charged by Termius Corporation until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free
    Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable
    Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
<p>At any time and without notice, Termius Corporation reserves the right to (i) modify
    the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
<h2>Fee Changes</h2>
<p>Termius Corporation, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
    Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of
    the
    then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
<p>Termius Corporation will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
    Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes
    effective.</p>
<p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into
    effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Termius Corporation
    on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Termius Corporation.</p>
<h2>Accounts</h2>

<p>You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service
    and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a
    third-party service.</p>
<p>You agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You must notify us
    immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>
<p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not
    lawfully available for use, a name or trade mark that is subject to any rights of another person or

# kx3util

## Installation Notes
The program requires that the 'Help', 'Libs', and 'Resources' directories are
all siblings to the main executable. In the previous version, this was done by
creating symbolic links to the bin directory the main executable lived in.

In the current release, all package files are installed together in an etc
directory, and a simple shell script that calls the main executable is installed
into the bin directory instead. This was done because the application was not
able to detect the help directory when installed in this manner.

## Help Notes
The help documentation requires a gtkhtml library to be installed, which is not
called out in their installation notes. At the time I put the package together,
installing this library required packages from the AUR which were failing to
install on my machine.

Instead of opening the help directly in the application, the utility provides
the ability to open the help documents in a browser instead. This has been
tested to work as an alternative.

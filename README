Main changes from mainline:
- add mbox support (for grabbing patchsets using b4)
- allow a slimmer config using SLIM=yes (using the included modprobed.db)
- copy signing keys for use with dkms (just add
  $kernel_source_Dir/certs/signing_key.pem/x509 as the mok_signing_key and
  certificate in /etc/dkms/framework.conf

To grab patchsets from the kernel mailing lists, use `b4` to grab entire
patchsets, e.g.:

    b4 am -o . 20231126192452.97824-1-dustin@howett.net

And add the resulting `.mbx` file to the `source` section in the PKGBUILD.

You can run `makepkg` with `env SLIM=yes` in theory to not build all the
modules, but you may want to modify `modprobed.db` to make sure it has all the
modules you need.

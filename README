This package is a fork of: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aide

The purposes of this fork are:
- to compile with mhash support by depending on mhash-pkg-config which includes the necessary pkg-config file (mhash.pc)
- to provide a more recent/updated version of AIDE
- to fix the source fork which cannot build properly due to missing sha256sums
- to provide a more expanded aide.conf file than the source fork

This package is hosted on github here: https://github.com/matthewspangler/aide-aur

These are the instructions to customize the linux-git package compilation in
case using the current Linux mainline is not desired:

* How to customize the git remote / branch:
  If a previous linux-git installation exists, please consult and edit the file
  /etc/linux-git/remote, otherwise use the file ./remote included in this AUR
  package.

* How to add user-customized config options:
  If a previous linux-git installation exists, please consult and edit the file
  /etc/linux-git/config, otherwise use the file ./config.user included in this
  AUR package.

* How to add extra patches on top of the selected remote / branch:
  If a previous linux-git installation exists, please consult and edit the file
  /etc/linux-git/patches/patches. If not, you can add the patches
  directly to the src/linux-torvalds/ git source. After compilation and
  installation, you can copy the patches to the directory
  /etc/linux-git/patches and follow the instructions included on
  /etc/linux-git/patches/patches file.

Set env variable IGNORE_USER_CUSTOM to build package ignoring current
customizations in place:
$ IGNORE_USER_CUSTOM=1 makepkg

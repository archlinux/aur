Hello!
I'm the current maintainer of the package, 
on my machine, aide with mhash capabilities enabled is not compiling 
due to the mhash pkg-config file (mhash.pc) missing.  

I've contacted with the current mhash maintainer for a fix, 
if you wish to have mhash compatbility to an unknown extent 
I've made a provisional mhash.pc file you can drop in "/usr/lib/pkgconfig/".
You'll have to uncomment the relevant line in the PKGBUILD.
I'm hoping this can be resolved ASAP, until then here's my "fix"
Regards,
John

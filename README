Some info about how I create this patch file:
- Using the official mutter PKGBUILD as a base.
- I fetch the gnome-control-center git repo.
- I download the VRR MR as a patch and apply it.
- If there are no conflicts, the patch can be applied as-is during prepare(). In case of conflicts, I resolve them and generate a new patch file.
- I apply the patch in the prepare() function.

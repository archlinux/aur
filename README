Some new cheap PCs do not have a pc-speaker device. That means the traditional
terminal beep will not work. As an ancient sem-deaf nerd I like the beep that
a terminal will produce when I do somethng wrong. GVim also has beeps :) yay

This package provides
  1) a kernel module suitable for dkms building. When installed using
     modprobe alsabeep it provides an event device that can be used
     to initiate a beep. 
  2) a helper bash script, alsabeep-helper and associated config
     file, alsabeep-helper.config that is configured to start a
     userspace daemon.
  3) a userspace daemon, alsabeep-daemon, that can make a beep
     noise using alsa. When started the daemon attempts to set
     its pid into /sys/module/alsabeep/parameters/helper_pid
     and als0 create a link /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr
     that can be used by the beep command.

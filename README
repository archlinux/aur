nftables-geoip-db
=================

nftables-geoip-db makes use of the new GeoLite2 MaxMind GeoIP data.

It creates country specific database files which can be used by nft command via an include statement.

Note: In the following text, CC represents 2 letter ISO code of a country, which you should replace as per your choice of the country.

Country specific files are stored in /usr/share/nft_geoip directory and are named as:

For IPv4: CC.ipv4
For IPv6: CC.ipv6

Each country specific file defines a variable which holds IP addresses specific to that country as per MaxMind GeoIP data.

Variable names are of the following form.

For IPv4: geoip4_iso_country_CC
For IPv6: geoip6_iso_country_CC

This variable can be used in nft statements (rules, sets etc.) to act based on country.


Example:
--------
#!/usr/bin/nft -f

# Purpose: allow SSH connections only from India (IN)

# create some basic rules
flush ruleset
add chain ip filter INPUT { type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop; }
add rule ip filter INPUT iif lo accept
add rule ip filter INPUT ct state established,related accept

# include the country specific file
include "/usr/share/nft_geoip/IN.ipv4"

# create a set containing IP addresses of India
add set ip filter geo_IN { type ipv4_addr; flags interval; elements = $geoip4_iso_country_IN }

# create rule to accept connection from IP address in the set
add rule ip filter INPUT ct state new tcp dport ssh ip saddr @geo_IN accept

# alternate form without creating a set
# add rule ip filter INPUT ct state new tcp dport ssh ip saddr $geoip4_iso_country_IN accept

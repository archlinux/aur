Objtool has some crude logic for detecting static "noreturn" functions
(aka "dead ends").  This is necessary for being able to correctly follow
GCC code flow when such functions are called.

It's remotely possible for two functions to call each other via sibling
calls.  If they don't have RET instructions, objtool's noreturn
detection logic goes into a recursive loop:

  drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_ssif.o: warning: objtool: return_hosed_msg()+0x0: infinite recursion (objtool bug!)
  drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_ssif.o: warning: objtool: deliver_recv_msg()+0x0: infinite recursion (objtool bug!)

Instead of reporting an error in this case, consider the functions to be
non-dead-ends.

Description=Monica CRM schedule:run Timer

[Timer]
# The Monica CRM installation instructions state that this should run every single minute.
# However, the most frequently scheduled tasks still only run once every hour.
# Running this every ten minutes is deemed to be a suitable compromise.
# Reference: app/Console/Kernel.php

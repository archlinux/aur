pkgbase = supertux-advance
	pkgdesc = a fan game of SuperTux written in Squirrel using Brux GDK. The name comes from the graphical style, which uses a lower resolution display and a sprite style similar to Sonic Advance. Gameplay is not a 1 to 1 recreation of SuperTux, nor does it aim to be. It's meant to be a more fast-paced action platformer than a Mario clone. While the gameplay is designed with speed running in mind, it is not an essential skill; the game can be played and beaten casually.

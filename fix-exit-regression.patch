Subject: [PATCH] Fix exit regression

Any time you start a job in the background vte gets confused and waits
several seconds for nothing to happen before exiting.

This regression was thanks to commit 7888602c
(lib: Rework child exit and EOF handling, 2019-11-17).

It can be triggered by simply doing:

  sleep infinity &
  exit

The maintainers of vte clearly have no intention fixing the issue that
was reported more than one year ago.

  https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/vte/-/issues/204

With this patch we can return to the behavior of 0.59, where the
terminal exits immediately.

Now you need to add OWASP CRS rules to your modsecurity:

# echo \"
Include crs-setup.conf
Include /usr/lib/nginx/modsecurity/crs/plugins/*-config.conf
Include /usr/lib/nginx/modsecurity/crs/plugins/*-before.conf
Include /usr/lib/nginx/modsecurity/crs/rules/*.conf
Include /usr/lib/nginx/modsecurity/crs/plugins/*-after.conf
\" >> /etc/nginx/modsecurity.conf
"
}

# Native horneroctl binary from GitHub Releases (canonical distribution,
# same pattern as agent-toolkit-bin). _reltag + pkgver + per-arch
# sha256sums are patched at publish time by .github/workflows/release.yml;
# the zero placeholders below fail fast if this template is built directly.
# _reltag carries the real GitHub tag because pkgver must be
# makepkg-safe (no hyphens), while tags use hyphens (v0.2.0-preview2).

# The release public key ships AS A PACKAGE SOURCE on purpose: AUR
# snapshot tarballs only include the PKGBUILD, .SRCINFO and declared
# local sources, so this is the only shipped file every install path
# (git clone, snapshot, AUR helper) is guaranteed to receive. Import it
# once with `gpg --import hornero-release.pub` (helpers may also
# fetch the same key from public keyservers); its fingerprint must
# match validpgpkeys below. The stamp step refreshes this file and its
# sha256 from packaging/keys/hornero-release.pub.asc at release time.

# Set to the committed release-key fingerprint by the release workflow.
# An unstamped template intentionally cannot pass makepkg signature checks.
# The same key ships next to this PKGBUILD in keys/pgp/<fingerprint>.asc
# (the Arch source-package convention) and on public keyservers, so AUR
# helpers and makepkg users can obtain it without trusting a keyserver
# response blindly: the fingerprint below is the pinned trust anchor and
# makepkg rejects any signature whose key does not match it. Never
# weaken signature verification to work around a missing key; see
# docs/RELEASE_SIGNING.md.

# findutils: provides the `find` back-end command used during traversal of the
#            skeleton user directory
# perl: provides the `perl` interpreter and standard libraries needed to
#       actually run the `adduser` and `deluser` scripts
# shadow: provides the back-end commands `useradd`, `usermod`, `groupadd` and
#         `gpasswd` used throughout the script
# util-linux: provides the `chfn` back-end command as well as the `nologin`
#             dummy shell for disabling login for users
# perl-locale-gettext: not required for the script to run, but if installed,
#                      you'll get localised/translated output based on your
#                      system locale
# quota-tools: provides the `edquota` back-end tool which is only needed if
#              the `QUOTAUSER` config option is used - see adduser.conf(5)
# tar: provides the `tar` back-end tool which is only needed if any of the
#      `BACKUP*` options are used or if passing any of the `--backup*`
#      arguments to `deluser` - see deluser(8) and deluser.conf(5)
# po4a: used during the packaging process to generate translated manpages

  # Arch's UID/GID policy differs a little from Debian's. I've included a patch
  # which issues the necessary changes to both the template configuration files
  # as well as the scripts themselves. These changes include the following:
  # * Automatically chosen system user/group IDs start at 500 instead of 100
  # * Automatically chosen regular user/group IDs end at 60000 instead of 59999
  # Sources: useradd(8) and /etc/login.defs
  # TODO: The translated manpages also need to be updated with the new default
  # options. I've neglected this for now because all of the translations for
  # adduser.conf(5) are currently rejected by `po4a` for being incomplete.
  # TODO: Improve user name regex. According to useradd(8) Arch allows
  # uppercase characters, underscores and numbers in the first character (but
  # not dashes). It may be sufficient to just remove the regex entirely as the
  # script includes additional non-configurable checks which seem to suffice.
  # TODO: That covers all of the policy differences I've noticed, but there may
  # be more that I didn't notice.

  # There are two problems with the output of `{add,del}user --version`. The
  # displayed version number is `VERSION` because it is expected that the
  # packager will replace this placeholder with the actual package version
  # number. Additionally, Arch puts the common license files in a different
  # directory, so the path to the GPL2 license file also needs to be adjusted.
  # I prefer using patchfiles, but because the version number comes from here
  # in the PKGBUILD, I have to do that patch using `sed`.
  # TODO: This is actually a very large patch, because I have to change the
  # license path in every translation file. Perhaps collaborating with upstream
  # to make this customisable by the packager would be a good idea.

# TODO: Automatic testing. This is difficult for four reasons:
# * It is not safe to run the tests on a real system, because a large number of
#   user accounts will be created and removed during the test runs, possibly
#   conflicting with real users. The tests should only be run in a user
#   namespace with it's own root filesystem, e.g. by using `makechrootpkg`
#   instead of `makepkg` or an AUR helper. Thus, we would need a way to prevent
#   the tests from being run automatically unless the user has signalled that
#   they understand this. This could be done, for example, by requiring them to
#   set an environment variable before running `makechrootpkg`.
# * The tests require the package to have been installed (i.e. the config files
#   have to be in /etc and the binaries in /usr/bin). I'll either have to work
#   around that within the PKGBUILD somehow, or patch the tests to use files
#   from the `$srcdir` directory.
# * The main test runner script attempts to run the test suite twice - once
#   with shadow passwords enabled, and once without. Arch does not seem to
#   support disabling shadow passwords, so the script will need to be patched
#   to avoid testing that.
# * The basic Arch root created using `mkarchroot` is missing the `users` and
#   `nogroup` groups which are required for most of the tests. So I would have
#   to create them manually (on a real system, `systemd-sysusers` would create
#   the `users` group automatically, but not `nogroup`)

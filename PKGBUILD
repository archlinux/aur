# AUR package: rosec-provider-keepassxc-file-bin
#
# This PKGBUILD installs the pre-built KeePassXC (.kdbx file) WASM provider
# for rosec from the GitHub release.  The provider reads a KeePassXC kdbx
# database directly from disk; KeePassXC remains the editor.
#
# This provider is currently marked EXPERIMENTAL upstream — interfaces and
# on-disk caching behaviour may change between releases.
#
# The release workflow renders this file by substituting 0.0.29 and
# aa9147c27dd28bf3ed1e434824805bd778df8d89c907e85b446a4d282c988ede before committing to the AUR.
#
# To build manually, replace the placeholders and run makepkg -si.

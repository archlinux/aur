# Todo: service for Pro/5 DataServer

# Basis bug: BLM is hard coded to use /usr/tmp (fixed herein)
# Basis bug: some Basis scripts have cosmetic errors (fixed herein)

# Build instructions:

# This PKGBUILD does not automatically download all files. Basis does not make
# all files available as direct links. It is not necessary to have a license
# to download, install, and run Pro/5. Without a license you get nag screens.

# At the Basis web site click Products, Downloads
# Choose a BASIS product: Pro/5
#   Platform: Linux
#   OS Level: Linux Kernel 2.6.17-1.2142_FC4+ AND glibc v2.3+ [Port 1045]
#   Revision: Latest or any
#   License Type: (*) Update existing software. (No license delivered.)
#     (Licensing will be handled during install. You may need to call Basis.)
#   Enter info... Download Product
#   Repeat for 64 bit: Linux Kernel v2.6+ AND glibc v2.3+ [Port 6045] - 64-bit
# Choose a BASIS product: Pro/5 Data Server
#   Repeat above for 1245 & 6245
# Place the 4 files in with PKGBUILD
# The BLM is downloaded automatically.

# If you already have license files, run "makepkg -oc" and place them
# in the appropriate z folders. This allows them to be built into the package
# for easy installs and upgrades. See below for files and folders.

# License concepts: (for those who aren't familiar with Macrovision FlexLM)

# The only product that requires a license file generated by Basis is the
# Basis License Manager (BLM). Every site must run at least one
# BLM server. A single BLM server on the same machine that runs Pro/5 is
# typical to get started. Developers may have a separate BLM server
# from production BLM servers.

# It is not necessary to have a functioning BLM server to try Pro/5. You can
# test suitability, functionality, run, extract data, and edit programs.
# Once your BLM server is licensed and running you can point your Pro/5
# installs to it and they will become fully functional without nag screens.

# While the BLM license is locked to the BLM server the HostID was generated
# on, BLM license checkout for Pro/5 instances are not machine locked,
# platform or OS specific. You can run Pro/5 on as many different machines
# and OS as you like. You can try other platforms to see if they are better
# suited to your needs. All you need is a BLM server with available licenses
# to point to. This PKGBUILD only handles Arch Linux.

# BLM License file security content may improve over time. Newer revisions
# of Pro/5 may require features not found in old license files or BLM servers.
# Contact Basis for an updated license file or for BLM server changes.
# Older revisions of Pro/5 are expected to run with newer licenses
# and BLM servers.

# Developer only licenses are available at a low yearly price.
# This is highly recommended for active developers.
# * You get get all features enabled. Good for testing to determine
#   whether a better licenses for production would be worthwhile.
# * You don't get kicked when the production BLM servers restart,
#   crash, or run out of licenses.
# * You don't consume one or more full licenses needed for users
#   on production systems.
# * If you develop on production systems you can use an altered
#   Pro/5 SERVER configuration so your runs use licenses from
#   the BLM serving your developers license.

# Install instructions

# Quick:
# * Purchase license
# * install basis-pro5 package
# * run BLM installer
# * install basis-pro5 package
# * start the BLM service
# * configure Pro/5 installations to use BLM server
# * copy the licenses to the PKGBUILD folder
# * remake the package with the licenses inside

# There are two installers. "./install" is found in /usr/local/basis.
# The "BLM installer" is in the build folder. Some functionality is offered
# by both installers but only works properly in one of them.

# 1. Purchase a license from Basis or a reseller. You are sent:
#    A. Order confirmation
#    B. Instructions with Serial and Authorization.
#
# 2. Install the basis-pro5 package.
#
# 3. Run the BLM installer.
# The BLM installer requires the Oracle Java JDK.
# Oracle JRE is not recommended and OpenJDK will not work.
# The right version will be installed by the basis-pro5 package.
# The BLM installer will run in GUI or Text mode.
#   sudo java -jar BLM1600_03-11-2016_1203.jar
#
# You can overwrite the files in /usr/local/basis/blmgr
# The server should be provided Internet access. The BLM installer will
# submit the serial and auth and retrieve the license.
# Stop at step "Configure BLM Startup"

# The first time the license is activated, the activated license for your BLM
# can be returned in as little as two minutes. If the license has already been
# activated and you're changing the BLM server to another system, you may need
# to call Basis to have your activation reset. This may require an active SAM
# plan or a one time fee. A license request without an activation reset will
# get you a license but it's only good for 7 days as a emergency license. Check
# your expiry date and if it's 7 days, plan on some time on the phone to get
# the licensing straightened out before the nag screens come up again.

# Note: Some licenses require periodic reactivation and Internet access to the
# server. See http://documentation.basis.com/BASISHelp/WebHelp/inst/basis_license_types.htm
#
# 4. Install the basis-pro5 package again to replace some patched files
# overwritten by the BLM installer.
# If you submitted by email, from ./install select: BLM, INSTALL
# Specify the .txt file you received. Enable and start your BLM with the
# systemctl commands below.
#
# 5. On all your Pro/5 installations run ./install and select
# PRO5, SERVER
# and specify the IP or DNS name of your running BLM server.

# Once installed you can copy the license files into your build folder
# for faster installs. Copy these files from /usr/local/basis into the
# package folder and make the package again.

# blmgr/*.lic -> zblmgr/
# blmgr/Register.properties -> zblmgr/
# pro5/BASIS.lic -> zpro5/

_opt_blgmgr_user='nobody' # default: root, the license manager should not be run as root
_opt_pro5_sql='pro5b'    # default: pro5b for non-sql, pro5s for sql
_opt_pro5_exe='bbx4'     # default: pro5, this link will be created in /usr/bin so
                         # Pro/5 is in the path. Select a name that minimizes the number of
                         # scripts you must modify.

# Up to 3 packages can be created
#   i686 for 32 bit systems
#   x86_64 for 64 bit systems
#   any for 64 bit systems running multilib
# They can all be made and ready for compatibility,
# performance, crash testing, or just carrying around for easy installs.

# To build and install package for native bitness:
# makepkg -sCcfi

# To build 32 bit package on 64 bit system
# makepkg -sCcf CARCH=i686

# To build 32 bit multilib package on 64 bit system
# makepkg -sCcf CARCH=any

# Once installed with an activated license you can enable and
# start the BLM service.

#   systemctl enable basis_lmgrd
#   systemctl start basis_lmgrd

# Try out your new Install in command line mode
# cd /usr/local/basis/pro5; unset BBTERM; ./pro5
# Try out your new Install in full screen mode
# cd /usr/local/basis/pro5; export BBTERM=T0; ./pro5

# Got READY> prompt with no nag screens, all good!
# Type BYE or RELEASE to exit

# So far as I know I've solved every one of the annoyances
# with the Basis install.
# If you have license nags check the logs at /var/log/basis/
# Check the status with
#   systemctl status basis_lmgrd.service

# The setup for a fully functioning Basis BBx Progression Pro/5 environment
# is extensive and not covered here.

# There are no man pages.

# Once installed you should add the utility folders ext, graphics, and std
# to your operating config.bbx. Old utilities should be removed if there are
# no modified versions. Many of the supplied utilities won't work unless all
# the utilities are the same version. To keep you from becoming dependant on
# custom changes to these files they are locked on install so even
# root can't edit them. If you want to customize an included utility, make
# a copy with a new name.

# Uninstall cleanup: rm -rf /var/log/basis /usr/local/basis

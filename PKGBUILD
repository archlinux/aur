# Maintainer: Nixuge

# Note: check if "depends" are still valid. As of 1.9, the AppImage
# Should contain everything already to just work everywhere.

# Note 2 (for future me & others):
# I really dislike using the AppImage for this package as it's slow to launch & kinda bloated
# Ideally I'd use the deb, which is 10MB instead of 50MB for the appimage
# 
# However, as of 1.9, the introduction of the "libayatana-appindicator" dependency has caused some problems on Arch,
# and is why the appimage became bloated in the first place to include everything for max compatibility
#
# This forces me to unfortunately stick with the appimage, as arch's "libayatana-appindicator" just segfaults
# 
# Could also redistribute debian's lib & patch the deb around, but I'd have to either:
# - Add another file to download from another source (more risks of it going down)
# - Add the raw file here directly (you'd have to trust me, or go check if the hash in the pkgbuild matches the one from an official src)
# 
# So for now just sticking with that. Will switch in the future if that lib implementation gets fixed.

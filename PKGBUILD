# Integration of the nvidia-patch from keylase.
#
# This patch removes restriction on maximum number of simultaneous NVENC video encoding sessions imposed by Nvidia to consumer-grade GPUs.
# You can read more about it here: https://github.com/keylase/nvidia-patch
#
# Note: Even if you do not enable this option, the package will still install nvidia-patch
# and you can accept it at any time using the corresponding commands: nvidia-patch-nvenc and nvidia-patch-fbc.
#
# WARNING: In extreme cases, this can damage the NVENC and NvFBC libraries.
_nvidia_patch=

# This setting has a setting option for NVIDIA PowerMizer power management technology, and it is used by default even if you have not configured it.
#
# This technology supports two modes of frequency management: Adaptive Strategy and Static Strategy.
# Adaptive frequency management is used by default by the driver, and implies that if the GPU is not tasked, it is in power saving mode.
# If the GPU power becomes necessary, then it increases it to the required performance level.
# In other words, it jumps between performance levels. Within this technology, there are three levels (also called modes):
# 1 (0x1 bit) - Maximum performance
# 2 (0x2 bit) - Balance between performance and power saving
# 3 (0x3 bit) - Powersaving
# You can fix the frequencies at a certain performance level only with a static strategy.
# Now that we have the theory sorted out, you can choose what you want depending on your configuration:
#
# Possible values:
# 1 - Static strategy with maximum performance for AC operation and maximum power savings for the battery
# 2 - Static strategy with maximum performance for AC operation, but an adaptive strategy for battery operation.
# 3 - Adaptive strategy for AC operation, but static strategy with maximum power saving for the battery.
#
# Note: Setting up the PowerMizer circuitry is not overclocking the GPU and assumes safe use for your hardware.
# However, you can reassign the behavior of the power scheme through the Xorg option "RegistryDwords".

_powermizer_scheme=

# Enforces applying a certain performance level
# (see description of _powermizer_scheme option above for details),
# while activating some GPU overclocking possibilities, such as:
# controlling GPU fan speed via nvidia-settings.
#
# Possible values:
# 1 - Force a balance between performance and powersaving
# 2 - Force max performnace (recommended for gaming)
#
# These settings apply to all power sources,
# and cannot be configured for each one individually
# as _powermizer_scheme does.
#
# Warning: Works only for laptops.

    # There are several packages that provide the "pynvml" module:
    # python-pynvml and python-nvidia-ml-py
    # Recently (v0.10.0) the author of nvitop started to use private functions of
    # python-nvidia-ml-py that python-pynvml doesn't provide. This was partly fixed in
    # https://github.com/XuehaiPan/nvitop/issues/44 but still shows a warning.
    # The problem is that python-nvidia-ml-py pulls in CUDA, a 5GiB dependency.
    # Until this is resolved I'd rather go with the warning than waste that much disk
    # space, because nvitop seems to work just the same (for me) with python-pynvml.
    # Feedback welcome!

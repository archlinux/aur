+ * find_energy_efficient_cpu(): Find most energy-efficient target CPU for the

+ * spare capacity in each performance domain and uses it as a potential
+ * candidate to execute the task. Then, it uses the Energy Model to figure
+ * out which of the CPU candidates is the most energy-efficient.
+ *
+ * The rationale for this heuristic is as follows. In a performance domain,
+ * all the most energy efficient CPU candidates (according to the Energy
+ * Model) are those for which we'll request a low frequency. When there are
+ * several CPUs for which the frequency request will be the same, we don't
+ * have enough data to break the tie between them, because the Energy Model
+ * only includes active power costs. With this model, if we assume that
+ * frequency requests follow utilization (e.g. using schedutil), the CPU with
+ * the maximum spare capacity in a performance domain is guaranteed to be among
+ * the best candidates of the performance domain.
+ *
+ * In practice, it could be preferable from an energy standpoint to pack
+ * small tasks on a CPU in order to let other CPUs go in deeper idle states,
+ * but that could also hurt our chances to go cluster idle, and we have no
+ * ways to tell with the current Energy Model if this is actually a good
+ * idea or not. So, find_energy_efficient_cpu() basically favors
+ * cluster-packing, and spreading inside a cluster. That should at least be
+ * a good thing for latency, and this is consistent with the idea that most
+ * of the energy savings of EAS come from the asymmetry of the system, and
+ * not so much from breaking the tie between identical CPUs. That's also the
+ * reason why EAS is enabled in the topology code only for systems where
+ * SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY is set.
+ *
+ * NOTE: Forkees are not accepted in the energy-aware wake-up path because
+ * they don't have any useful utilization data yet and it's not possible to
+ * forecast their impact on energy consumption. Consequently, they will be
+ * placed by find_idlest_cpu() on the least loaded CPU, which might turn out
+ * to be energy-inefficient in some use-cases. The alternative would be to
+ * bias new tasks towards specific types of CPUs first, or to try to infer
+ * their util_avg from the parent task, but those heuristics could hurt
+ * other use-cases too. So, until someone finds a better way to solve this,
+ * let's keep things simple by re-using the existing slow path.

# Changes in version 7.3.0:

### Deprecation

- Keyword dev for specifying an interface name to use for program and map offload
  with bpftool prog load ... dev <ifname> and bpftool map create ... dev <ifname>
  is deprecated. Use offload_dev instead. (3270b21)

### New features

The objective for the above deprecation is to avoid confusion with a new
interface-related keyword:

- Support passing an interface name with xdpmeta_dev <ifname> for resolving XDP
  hints kfuncs when loading programs with bpftool prog load. (3270b21)

The information displayed for BPF links (bpftool link list) has been enriched:

- Show map IDs along with struct_ops links. (d89768b)
- Show target_obj_id and target_btf_id along with tracing links information. (57fc1ef)
- Show details for multi-kprobes links. (b65dc7b)
- Show details for perf event links. (bd2f4d6, 7561b06)
- Show details for netfilter links. (103f441)
- Show details (interface, attach types) for tcx links. (b76b36e)
- Show details (interface) for XDP links. (9f6d353)
- Show details (interface, attach types) for netkit links. (0fcd8de)
- Show the count of missed kprobes for multi-kprobes links and perf event links. (aa4f5fb, 58046e2)

Several new networking program types also get their information displayed with bpftool net list:

- Print information on netfilter programs. (103f441)
- Print information on tcx programs. (4294230)
- Print information on netkit programs. (d712a3e)

Other features:

- Support the new cgroup UNIX socket attach points for attaching programs with
  bpftool prog attach. These attach points are: connect_unix, sendmsg_unix,
  recvmsg_unix, getpeername_unix, getsockname_unix. (087d22a)
- For struct_ops, support registering structs in the .struct_ops.link ELF
  section (in addition to .struct_ops), and also create a link for structs in that
  section. Accept an optional directory path when registering struct_ops (bpftool
  struct_ops register OBJ [LINK_DIR]), to indicate where to pin such links.
  (9d58b65, 6b24c3e)
- Dump inner map IDs instead of raw values when dumping maps of maps with
  bpftool map dump. (e552682)
- Display kernel module name when relevant for symbols printed as part of a
  program dump (bpftool prog dump xlated). (eb8a15a)
- Support LLVM's v4 instructions in the disassembler. (ad25b69)

### Bug fixes

- Fix the long-standing bug (#17) what would prevent from building bpftool with
  features requiring the use of “skeletons” (feature-clang-bpf-co-re compilation
  option) with kernels older than 5.15 or without CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS set.
  (1f5829e, 0773871, fc96090, b00d0c5)
- On aarch64, when probing features (bpftool feature probe), fix the value of
  the global memory limit for JIT compiler for unprivileged users, which was
  previously reported as a negative value (expecting an int instead of a long).
  (b2489e0)
- When passing a directory to pin programs to bpftool prog loadall, avoid
  re-mounting accidentally the bpffs to the parent of that directory. (fb96eed)
- Fix a warning (-Wcast-qual) that might appear when compiling skeletons
  generated with bpftool gen. (24f4661)
- When generating skeletons, align on a 8-byte boundary the data retrieved from
  ELF files to avoid potential alignment issues and errors from libbpf. (e8b7df5,
  f12f538)
- When printing pointers in JSON, for example as part of a struct_ops dump with
  bpftool -j struct_ops dump, enquote the pointer address (or (nil) value) to
  avoid breaking JSON. (5978b98)
- Fix JSON for struct_ops dumps from an ID with bpftool -j struct_ops dump id
  <id> by wrapping the information for the structs in an array. (b9530de)
- Fix a subcommand name (prog instead of program) in bpftool.8 manual page.
  (fa46ebb)
- Fix the interactive help message for bpftool perf. (dc53c79)

### Known bugs

- Command bpftool cgroup tree may be broken when running with kernels under v6.1 (#41).


# Changes in version 7.2.0:

### Breaking change:

- When trying to dump the control flow graph (CFG) for a BPF program (bpftool
  prog dump xlated <program> visual), return an error if the user passed one of
  the --json or --pretty options, instead of simply ignoring the option.

### New features

- Support printing the C source code (inline annotations), if available, in the
  CFGs for programs. Also support line numbers and opcodes in the CFGs with the
  linum and opcodes keywords, just like for regular program dumps.
- In the Makefile's feature detection for the mirror repository, output the
  name, results, and stderr when probing features with V=1.

### Bug fixes

- Fix linkage with statically built LLVM libraries for the disassembler for
  JIT-compiled BPF programs. Some flags and libraries were missing.
- With bpftool prog profile, profile online CPUs instead of “possible” CPUs,
  given that some of the latter may not be online and hence not available for
  profiling.
- In BPF-related feature probing, avoid marking kernel config option as not set
  if the kernel configuration file is not found.
- In the Makefile, add missing quotes to libbpf bootstrap submake variables, to
  fix use cases where $(HOSTCC) is set to /usr/bin/ccache /usr/bin/gcc, for
  example.
- Fix a bug in the JSON writer, which would produce an escaped line break
  instead of escaped backslash for a \ character.
- Fix another bug in the JSON writer, about an invalid JSON escape for \'.
- Fix bug for long instructions (such as loading a 64-bit long immediate into a
  register) not displayed properly in program CFG dumps.
- Fix documentation about line information display for program dumps: the
  document hinted that displaying the source line could be turn off, and that
  the file name would be printed “on top of” the source line, but these
  indications were not accurate.
- Ignore $(CFLAGS), use $(EXTRA_CFLAGS) in the Makefile's feature detection
  framework, thus mirroring the behavior of the kernel version. On top of that,
  fix feature detection for static builds.
- Fix the feature detection system to account for $(FEATURE_TESTS) defined in
  the main Makefile.

### Other internal changes

- Add static build instructions for bpftool in the README.md of the mirror
  repository.
- Use bpf_{btf,link,map,prog}_get_info_by_fd() (wrappers around
  bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd()), to improve type safety in the code, and to help
  with the Memory Sanitizer.
- Always disable stack protection for building BPF programs used by bpftool. If
  present, as is the default on Gentoo for example, stack protection for the
  clang toolchain would produce errors when trying to compile the relevant object
  files, but stack protection is not relevant in the case of BPF programs and it
  is safe to turn it off.

### CI

- Add a release workflow to build and ship static binaries for amd64 and arm64
  (and SHA256 sums) on releases (the workflow creates a draft release when tags
  are pushed, and attaches the assets). Also use this workflow to ship a tarball
  containing all sources required to compile (bpftool, plus libbpf submodule).
  Add a script to update GitHub labels for some of these release assets.
- Add a workflow for static builds with both LLVM and libbfd disassemblers. The
  early version for the LLVM disassembler would include compiling the LLVM
  libraries and take around 80 minutes to complete, but later we switched to
  downloading libraries compatible with static linking from LLVM's CI, cutting
  down the duration for the workflow to about 2 minutes.
- Remove deprecated Ubuntu 18.04 GitHub runner from the CI in the matrix for
  the build workflow.
- In workflow definitions, add concurrency groups to cancel outdated runs.
- Add path filters to workflow definitions, to avoid running all workflows if
  some are not relevant for a given Pull Request.
- Add a CI workflow to make sure GitHub mirror commits have valid prefixes
  (mirror: or sync: or ci: only, so we can easily distinguish them from the
  commits coming from the kernel repository).
- Switch to the Hadolint linter for checking the Dockerfile, and improve the
  related workflow.

### Known bugs

- Some features requiring the use of “skeletons” (feature-clang-bpf-co-re
  compilation option) require kernel 5.15 or more recent, with
  CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS set, to compile bpftool (#17).
- Command bpftool cgroup tree may be broken when running with kernels under
  v6.1 (#41).

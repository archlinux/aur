Changes in version 0.5.0:

Breaking changes:

- Repository options in the config file can no longer be given under the [global] section. Use [repository] instead.
- Backing up multiple sources on the command line now results in one instead of several snapshots.

Bugs fixed:

- restore command did not restore empty files. This is fixed.
- config command did save the config file compressed which violates the repo design. This is fixed.
- rustic did panic when files with missing content field are stored in a tree. This is fixed.

New features:

- Experimental windows support has been added.
- New option --filter-fn allows to implement your own snapshot filter using the Rhai language.
- New command dump has been added.
- New command merge has been added.
- Support for extended file attributes has been added.
- REST/Rclone backend: Allow to set the request timeout.
- Extra or wrong fields in the config file now lead to rustic complaining and aborting.
- New option --no-progress has been added.
- Option --progress-interval can now also be given as command argument and in the config file.
- backup: Paths are now sanitized from command arguments and config file before matching and applying the configuration.
- restore: Add --no-ownership option
- check --read-data: progress bar now also shows total bytes to check and ETA.
- The archiver implementation has been reworked. This will allow more backup sources in future.
- Updated to Rust 1.68 and many dependency updates


Changes in version 0.4.4:

Bugs fixed:

- Integrated the cdc crate as it currently doesn't compile with current Rust. This allows to upload rustic to crates.io.
- restore: Don't abort on errors, but print a warning and continue
- REST backend now ignores extra files in repository, as local backend does.
- init did not work for hot/cold repos. This is fixed.
- A password file without a newline didn't work. This is fixed.

New features:

- diff/restore: Allow to use a single file as target and treat it correctly

# Changes in version 1.1.0

Added:

- Server can now be run without permission to change the system clock so long as
  no time sources are configured.
- Experimental NTPv5 draft support was added behind a feature flag (disabled by
  default)

Changed:

- The sources section can be left out of the configuration now.
- When no sources are configured, the daemon will merely state it won't change
  system time, rather than warn
- The MSRV was raised to 1.67

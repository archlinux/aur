# Changes in version 0.7.0:

Backend and Configuration:

- Added many new backends using OpenDAL, including SFTP (on Unix) and S3. See the config examples.
- Added the new webdav command.
- Rclone backend: Added options rclone-command, use-password, rest-url.
- Backend options can now be defined for hot and cold repository parts
  separately using [repository.options-hot] and [repository.options-cold].

Backup and Restore:

- Backup scanning for size and start of the actual backup is now parallelized.
- Added --no-scan option to prevent scanning for the backup size.
- Added --custom-ignorefile option to use .gitignore-behavior with custom filenames.
- Added --skip-identical-backup option to skip saving the snapshot if it is identical to the parent.
- New option --quiet for backup and forget command.

Repository Management:

- ls: New option --numeric-id (can also be used as --numeric-uid-gid).
- prune: New option --early-delete-index allows running prune with full discs.
- The default for --max-repack has been changed to "10%".

UI and Usability Improvements:

- Help texts are now colored again. We may change that in a future release when reworking the CLI.
- Improved progress bars, e.g., for the copy command.

Optimizations:

- Reduced memory requirements, especially for large repositories.

Build and Deployment:

- Added a Dockerfile for building a rustic Docker image.
- Added the possibility to build an RPM package.
- Many improvements to the internal build process and CI pipeline.
- Building rustic with self-update and webdav commands is now an optional feature.

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed repository errors after entering a password, which now show up instead of re-prompting for the password.
- Fixed an issue where the backup command could abort in the unlikely case of a
  time shift during backup (e.g., caused by NTP syncing).
- Fixed missing cache files printing a warning.
- Fixed repair index wrongly setting to-delete for newly read pack files.
- Allowed diff to use local: in path syntax, enabling comparison with Windows paths.
- Fixed init not working as expected for hot/cold repositories due to a regression.
- Made output from config file handling identical to other log messages.


# Changes in version 0.6.1:

Rustic 0.6.1 fixes some small bugs from 0.6.0 including (hopefully) the broken CI for building binaries.


# Changes in version 0.6.0:

Breaking Changes:

- We refactored to rustic_core. This means that most of the underlying logic can now be used as a library. The
  CLI is now a thin wrapper around the library. This also means that the CLI is now much more customizable. Please
  check out the documentation for more information.

Bug Fixes:

- Retrying backend access didn't work for long operations. This has been fixed (and retries are now customizable)
- Prune did abort when no time was set for a pack-do-delete. This case is now handled correctly.
- The zstd compression library led to data corruption in very unlikely cases. This has been fixed by a dependency update.
- The glob option did only work with absolute files. This has been fixed.
- Non-unicode link targets are now correctly handled on Unix (after this has been added to the restic repo format).
- The --dry-run option now works as expected in the init command.

Features:

- New global configuration paths are available, located at /etc/rustic/*.toml or
  %PROGRAMDATA%/rustic/config/*.toml, depending on your platform.
- REST backend: Now allows to use custom TLS root certificates.
- Environment variables for programms called by rustic can now be set in the config files.
- Creation of new keys now enforces confirmation of entered key. This helps to
  prevent mistype of passwords during the initial entry
- Wait for password-command to successfully exit, allowing to input something
  into the command, and read password from stdout.
- backup: New option --init to initialize repository if it doesn't exist yet.
- backup: New option no-require-git - if enabled, a git repository is not required to apply git-ignore rule.
- restore: The restore algorithm has been improved and should now be faster for remote repositories.
- restore: Files are now allocated just before being first processed. This allows easier resumed restores.
- repoinfo: Added new options --json, --only-files, --only-index.
- check: Add check if time is set for packs-to-delete.
- ls: Options --long (-l) and --summary (-s) have been added.
- forget: Option --json has been added.


# Changes in version 0.5.4:

Bugs fixed:

- backup crashed when there was a non-unicode link target. The crash has been
  fixed. However, non-unicode link targets are still unsupported.
- Extended attributes which were saved with value null couldn't be handled. This has been fixed.
- prune: --max-repack didn't work with a given percentage of repo size. This has been fixed.

New features:

- copy: Added --init option to initialize uninitialized target repos
- dependencies have been updated


# Changes in version 0.5.3:

Breaking changes:

- config file: use-config now expects an array of config profiles to read.

Bugs fixed:

- The [[backup.sources]] section in the config file was ignored 0.5.2. This has been fixed.

New features:

- The show-config command has been added.


# Changes in version 0.5.2:

Breaking changes:

- The CLI option --config-profile was renamed into --use-profile (same shortcut -P).

Bugs fixed:

- restore: Warm-up options given by the command line didn't work. This has been fixed.
- backup: showed 1 dir as changed when backing up without parent. This has been fixed.
- diff: The options --no-atime and --ignore-devid had no effect and are now removed.
- Rustic's check of additional fields in the config file didn't work in edge cases. This has been fixed.

New features:

- backup: Backing up (small) files has been speed-optimized and is now much more parallelized.
- Config file: New field use-profile under [global] allows to merge options from other config profiles
- Option --dry-run is now a global option and can also be defined in the config file or via env variable
- forget: Using "-1" as value for --keep-* options will keep all snapshots of that interval
- prune: Added option --repack-all
- Updated to clap v4


# Changes in version 0.5.1:

Breaking changes:

- ls: Added option --recursive, note: default is now non-recursive if a path is given.

Bugs fixed:

- Fixed compilation on OpenBSD.
- Fixed shell completions.
- REST backend displayed the connection password in the log. This has been changed.
- restore: Existing symlinks displayed an error. This is now corrected if the --delete option is used.
- restore: Setting ownership/permissons/times for symlinks failed. This has been fixed.
- Spaces in paths did not work when given in the config file. This has been fixed.
- backup --stdin-filename did not use the given filename. This has been fixed.
- backup always displayed at least 1 dir as changed. This has been corrected.
- Windows: Backup of the path prefix (e.g. C: -> C/) did not work. This has been fixed.

New features:

- REST backend: Set User-Agent header.
- ls: Added option --recursive.
- ls: Added glob options to exclude/include.
- restore: Added glob options to exclude/include.
- restore: xattrs treatment has been improved.
- Dependencies have been updated.


# Changes in version 0.5.0:

Breaking changes:

- Repository options in the config file can no longer be given under the [global] section. Use [repository] instead.
- Backing up multiple sources on the command line now results in one instead of several snapshots.

Bugs fixed:

- restore command did not restore empty files. This is fixed.
- config command did save the config file compressed which violates the repo design. This is fixed.
- rustic did panic when files with missing content field are stored in a tree. This is fixed.

New features:

- Experimental windows support has been added.
- New option --filter-fn allows to implement your own snapshot filter using the Rhai language.
- New command dump has been added.
- New command merge has been added.
- Support for extended file attributes has been added.
- REST/Rclone backend: Allow to set the request timeout.
- Extra or wrong fields in the config file now lead to rustic complaining and aborting.
- New option --no-progress has been added.
- Option --progress-interval can now also be given as command argument and in the config file.
- backup: Paths are now sanitized from command arguments and config file before matching and applying the configuration.
- restore: Add --no-ownership option
- check --read-data: progress bar now also shows total bytes to check and ETA.
- The archiver implementation has been reworked. This will allow more backup sources in future.
- Updated to Rust 1.68 and many dependency updates


# Changes in version 0.4.4:

Bugs fixed:

- Integrated the cdc crate as it currently doesn't compile with current Rust. This allows to upload rustic to crates.io.
- restore: Don't abort on errors, but print a warning and continue
- REST backend now ignores extra files in repository, as local backend does.
- init did not work for hot/cold repos. This is fixed.
- A password file without a newline didn't work. This is fixed.

New features:

- diff/restore: Allow to use a single file as target and treat it correctly
- local backend: Added possibility to add hooks. This can be used e.g. to
  automatically generate .par2 files for your local repo.
- backup: Added option --json
- The chunker implementation has been optimized
- Default grouping now includes grouping by labels
- Added OpenBSD as platform
- Many version updates of dependencies

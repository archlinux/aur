0.9.2 2021-07-02

Small changes are introduced regarding copy, search and sort.

Changed (small ones):

- The search is now smartcase like in vim.
- The list is sorted case-insensitively.
- Searching is now considering the pattern to be space separated keywords. The
  search result requires all keywords are in the password name, naturally.
- Copy will copy only the right hand side of colon ":" if exists.

Fixed:

- Check if pass directory exists.
- Colors of focused items in light color schemes now have correct reverse effects.
- Do not move cursor after inserting a new item if the path is absolute.
- Prevent focus change when in editbox.

0.9.1 2021-06-28

Bugs fix release.

Fixed:

- Preview not updating due to name duplicates, e.g., when switching between a
  folder item and a file item with the same name.
- Folder's count not updating after the item within are added/removed.
- Git commit messages flashing by after editing password. Now it has been
  worked around.
- When creating multi-level filename, e.g. "foo/bar", instead of using that
  whole name as a single file, now shows directory hierarchy correctly.
- Fix new item not showing if a dir with the same name exists.

0.9.0 2021-06-25

Added:

- Search within the current folder, i.e., current window. Key bindings are vim-like:
  / search forward.
  ? search backward.
  n goto next.
  N goto previous.

Fixed:

- Position indicator not updating when moving the cursor up and down.


0.8.2 2021-06-23

`cpass` is uploaded to pypi!

Fixed:

- When copy fails (possibly due to no X11), cpass will crash. Its output also
  messes the UI. Note after the fix the original error message is also blocked.


0.8.1 2021-06-20

Fixed:

- Save the log file in system temporary folder, normally `/tmp` for Linux.
  It was saved to the current location where cpass is started.


0.8.0 2021-06-19

Changed:

- Renamed the executable to `cpass`, the extension was removed. This breaks
  compatibility in a way, but I did not start a new major version, since I have
  not promoted cpass to anyone yet so the impact is nearly zero. Nobody cares.


0.7.0 2021-06-16

Added:

- Copy password, any line or specific field.

Fixed:

- Correct the default keybindings.


0.6.1 2021-06-12

Fixed:

- Warn the deletion with full path.
- Use `y` to copy, which is the actual initially planned key binding.


0.6.0 2021-06-07

Added:

- Key binding customization support in the configuration file.

Fixed:

- Warning not shown for different password input.
- Crash if there is no colors section in the configuration file.


0.5.0 2021-06-07

Added:

- Deleting passwords/folders with `pass rm -r`.

Fixed:

- Previous messages might persist after unfocusing the editbox.
- Enter key not working on folders.


0.4.1 2021-06-03

Added:

- Focus the new/changed item after insert or generate.

Fixed:

- Update password preview after edit, insert or generate.


0.4.0 2021-06-02

Changed:

- Configuration option 'preview' is changed to 'preview_layout'.
- Keybinding changes: only use 'i' for insert and only 'a' for generate.

Added:

- Generate password by `pass generate`.

Fixed:

- The UI actually updates with password operations like insert, generate, etc.


0.3.1  2021-05-30

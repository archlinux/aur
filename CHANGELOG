Updated to https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc/commit/ea050190466f5336c69c6a11baa1cb686677fcab
Fix build with Leptonica >=1.83.

v0.29-4:

jbig2enc 0.29-4 contains a patch to set the dpi of images without dpi information. See here:
https://github.com/agl/jbig2enc/pull/52/commits/cd6c1df2e3475237206385bf8a373bbe06932d86
It won't do anything unless you use it, but it hasn't been tested.
Edit the PKGBUILD to remove this patch ("dpi.patch") if you prefer.

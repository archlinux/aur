Changes in version 0.5.3:

Changes in version 0.5.2:

- Spaces in paths did not work when given in the config file. This has been fixed.
- backup --stdin-filename did not use the given filename. This has been fixed.

Changes in version 0.5.0:

- Repository options in the config file can no longer be given under the [global] section. Use [repository] instead.
- Backing up multiple sources on the command line now results in one instead of several snapshots.

Bugs fixed:

- restore command did not restore empty files. This is fixed.
- config command did save the config file compressed which violates the repo design. This is fixed.

New features:

- Experimental windows support has been added.

- New command dump has been added.
- New command merge has been added.

- Updated to Rust 1.68 and many dependency updates


Changes in version 0.4.4:

Bugs fixed:

- Integrated the cdc crate as it currently doesn't compile with current Rust. This allows to upload rustic to crates.io.

- A password file without a newline didn't work. This is fixed.

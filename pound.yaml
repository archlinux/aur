#
# Specify the user Pound will run as (must be defined in /etc/passwd).
# User: "pound"

# Specify the group Pound will run as (must be defined in /etc/group).
# Group: "pound"

# Specify the directory that Pound will chroot to at runtime. Please note that
# SSL may require access to /dev/urandom, so make sure you create a device by
# that name, accessible from the root jail directory. Pound may also require
# access to /dev/syslog or similar.
# RootJail: "/"

# Backends
#
# A back-end is a definition of a single back-end server Pound will use to
# reply to incoming requests. Each backend must be marked with an anchor (&).
Backends:
  - &default_backend
    # The address that Pound will connect to. This can be a numeric IP address,
    # or a symbolic host name that must be resolvable at  run-time. This is a
    # mandatory parameter.
    Address: localhost

    # The port number that Pound will connect to. This is a mandatory parameter.
    Port: 8080

    # How long to wait for a backend (server) to complete and operation.
    # Default: 15 (seconds).
    Timeout:

    # How many threads will be used to service requests to this backend. See
    # also below for remarks on performance tuning. Default: 8 (threads).
    Threads:

    # A header to add to each reply received from this backend. The header is a
    # string.
    # HeadAdd:

# HTTPListeners
#
# An HTTP listener defines an address and port that Pound will listen on for
# HTTP requests.
HTTPListeners:
  -
    # The  address  that Pound will listen on. This can be a numeric IP address,
    # or a symbolic host name that must be resolvable at run-time. This is a
    # mandatory parameter. The address 0.0.0.0 may be used as an alias for 'all
    # available addresses on this machine', but this practice is strongly
    # discouraged.
    Address: localhost

    # The port number that Pound will listen on.  This is a mandatory parameter.
    Port: 80

    # Define how long Pound will wait for client activity. Default: 5 (seconds).

    Services:

      -
        # The service will only be used if the request URL matches the given
        # pattern.
        URL:

        # Use the service only if any of the request headers matches the given
        # pattern.
        HeadRequire:

        # Use the service only if none of the request headers matches the given
        # pattern.
        HeadDeny:

        # How long to keep the client sessions (in seconds). Sessions are a
        # long term association between a client IP address and a specific
        # backend in this service. A value of 0 seconds means no sessions are
        # kept. Default: 0.
        Session:

        # A list of references to previously defined backends.

    # A file name or a list of file names. Each file must contain a certificate,
    # optionally additional chained certificates up to a known  certificate
    # authority,  and  the private key corresponding to the certificate.
    # Note: the private key should probably not be password-protected, as Pound
    # normally starts as a daemon and cannot ask for the password at start-up
    # time.
    # Certificates:

    # A list of acceptable cipher names for this listener. The negotiation with
    # the client will result in one of these ciphers being used, or the

== 3.11.0 (2023-02-08)

## Enhancements

* Add `--policy` option to `globus session update` which takes a comma
  delimited list of Globus Auth policy IDs and starts an auth flow to
  meet the policies.

* Whenever an error is hit due to not meeting a Globus Auth policy, helptext
  is displayed with a `globus session update` command to resolve the error.

* Support `--user-message` and `--user-message-link` for
  `globus endpoint update` and `globus gcp create mapped`

## Other

* Improve the uniformity of endpoint and collection option parsing.
** The `--sharing-restrict-paths` option to `globus collection update` now
   checks for invalid types (non-dict, non-null data)
** `globus endpoint update` now treats the empty string as null for the
   following options: `--contact-email`, `--contact-info`,
   `--default-directory`, `--department`, `--description`, `--info-link`,
   and `--organization`. This behavior matches `globus collection update`.
   `--no-default-directory` is still supported, but is equivalent to
   `--default-directory ""`
** `globus gcp create guest` and `globus gcp create mapped` now accept
   `--verify [force|disable|default]` for verification options. This replaces
   `--disable-verify/--no-disable-verify`, which is now deprecated

== 3.10.1 (2022-12-06)

Bugfixes:

* Fix a typo in the `globus endpoint permission update` command

* Fixed an AttributeError preventing text output of `globus session show`

== 3.10.0 (2022-12-05)

Bugfixes:

* Fix a bug which caused `globus list-commands` not to show proper information

Enhancements:

* Add the `globus api flows` command for direct interactions with the Globus
  Flows service

* Added commands for interacting with GCSv5 user credentials
** `globus endpoint user-credential list`
** `globus endpoint user-credential show`
** `globus endpoint user-credential delete`
** `globus endpoint user-credential create`
*** `globus endpoint user-credential create from-json`
*** `globus endpoint user-credential create posix`
*** `globus endpoint user-credential create s3`

* Added `globus endpoint storage-gateway list`

* Add `globus flows delete` to delete a flow by ID

* Add a new command, `globus flows show` which displays information about a
  single flow

* Add `globus flows start` as a new command for starting a flow.

* Add `globus login --flow <flow_id>` to trigger a login that asks for consent to start a flow.

* `globus ls` has improved behavior when the `--filter` and `--recursive` options
   are used in combination

** directory names are not matched against the filter, allowing the operation to
   traverse directories regardless of their names

** the `--filter` is still applied to filenames in all directories traversed by
   the `ls` operation

** directory names can be filtered out of the text output by eliminating
   lines which end in `/`

** the behaviors of `globus ls` commands with `--recursive` or `--filter`, but not
   both, are unchanged

Other:

* `globus endpoint create` is now hidden and displays a deprecation warning
  when used

* Support Python 3.11.

* Endpointish now uses `entity_type` for determining EntityType

== 3.9.0 (2022-10-13)

Bugfixes:

* Fix a bug in text output for `globus transfer --dry-run` which crashed with a
  `KeyError` if `--external-checksum` was omitted

Enhancements:

* A new command, `globus flows list`, allows users to list Flow objects in
  Globus Flows

* New commands for creating Globus Connect Personal endpoints and collections
** `globus gcp create mapped` creates a GCP Mapped Collection
** `globus gcp create guest` creates a GCP Guest Collection

In GCP, the Mapped Collection and Endpoint are synonymous. Therefore,
`globus gcp create mapped` replaces the functionality previously only available
via `globus endpoint create --personal`.

NOTE: Neither of the `globus gcp create` commands automatically installs Globus
Connect Personal on the local machine. These commands complement and interact with
an existing installation.

Other:

* `globus endpoint create` is now documented as deprecated. Users are
  encouraged to use `globus gcp create` for Globus Connect Personal,
  and the Globus Connect Server CLI for Globus Connect Server

* `globus endpoint create` no longer accepts `--no-default-directory` as an
  option. It previously did nothing when used.

== 3.8.0 (2022-08-31)

Enhancements:

* The globus CLI is now faster to start in many cases. Tab completions are most
  significantly improved, but other commands may demonstrate an improvement as
  well

* Add the `globus api timer` command for direct interactions with the Globus
  Timer service

* Order `globus task list` by descending request time to prioritise
  newer tasks in default output

== 3.7.0 (2022-08-05)

Bugfixes:

* Fix `globus session update` help text not handling missing domain errors from Transfer

Enhancements:

* `globus group member invite` now supports provisioning new identities in
  Globus Auth in order to support inviting new users who have not created
  Globus accounts. Use `--provision-identity` to indicate that new users
  should be auto-provisioned in Globus Auth

* Add new `globus timer` commands for interacting with the Timer service:
** `globus timer list` to list jobs
** `globus timer show` to show a particular job

* Add `globus search index delete` command

== 3.6.0 (2022-06-08)

Enhancements:

* Commands which have required arguments will print their helptext if invoked
  with no arguments. They still `exit(2)` (usage error). This only applies to
  the case of a command with required arguments being called with no arguments
  at all.

Bugfixes:

* Fix behavior of `globus api` to respect formatting options. `--jmespath` can
  be used on results, and `-Fjson` will pretty-print JSON responses if the
  original response body is compact JSON

Other:

* Increase the maximum width of help output to 80% of the terminal size.
* Remove support for python3.6 . Users on python3.6 should still be able to
  install `globus-cli` but will not be able to update to the latest version.

== 3.5.0 (2022-05-05)

Bugfixes:

* `globus endpoint activate --web` now correctly respects the environment when
  it is set

Enhancements:

* Add a new command, `globus api`, which can be used to make requests to curl-like
  requests to Globus services using the credentials from a globus-cli login
* Add commands for interacting with individual documents in Globus Search:
  `globus search subject show` and `globus search subject delete`

== 3.4.0 (2022-03-11)

Enhancements:

* New commands for interacting with Globus Groups
** `globus groups set-policies` to manage a group's policies
** `globus group member list` to list members of a group
** `globus group member invite` to invite a member to join a group
** `globus group member approve` to approve a member who has requested to join a group
** `globus group member reject` to reject a member who has requested to join a group
** `globus group invite accept` to accept an invitation to a group
** `globus group invite decline` to decline an invitation to a group
** `globus group join` to join a group, with an option `--request` for groups
   which require approval for members
** `globus group leave` to leave a group
* `globus group member add` now supports the `--role` argument for adding
    members with the `manager` and `admin` roles
* A new command for interacting with Globus Search,
  `globus search delete-by-query` to bulk-delete data from a Globus Search index

Bugfixes:

* Fix an issue which caused certain commands like `globus mkdir` to retry
  incorrectly when failing, leading to unnecessary delays on failure

== 3.3.0 (2022-02-18)

Enhancements:

* Add Globus Search commands for managing index roles. These are
  `globus search index role list`, `globus search index role create`, and
  `globus search index role delete`

* Added new commands for manipulating groups
** `globus group create` creates a new group
** `globus group show` shows group information
** `globus group update` updates group name or description
** `globus group delete` deletes a group

Bugfixes:

* Update the version of `globus-sdk` used, fixing an issue which caused
  `globus task show --skipped-errors` and
  `globus task show --successful-transfers` to only show partial output

== 3.2.0 (2022-01-13)

Enhancements:

* Add a `globus group member add` command to add users to a group
* Add a `globus group member remove` command to remove a user from a group
* Add a new `globus search index show` command which displays an index by ID
* Add a new `globus search index list` command which lists indices for which
  the current user has permissions
* Add a new `globus search index create` command which creates a new Globus
  Search index. Note that because the index creation API is in public beta, the
  command is also labeled as "beta"
* Add docs on `GLOBUS_PROFILE` setting to help for login and logout commands
* Add support for client credentials for authentication in the Globus CLI
  by setting `GLOBUS_CLI_CLIENT_ID` and `GLOBUS_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET`
  environment variables
** Both variables must be set to enable this behavior
** Tokens generated with client credentials are cached in the current user's home
   directory, but isolated from any user credentials
** With client credentials, `globus login` is invalid, but `globus logout` can be used
   to revoke any cached tokens
** Attempting to run `globus login` while using client credentials will show an
   appropriate error message
* A new command, `globus cli-profile-list` can be used to list values for
  `GLOBUS_PROFILE` and `GLOBUS_CLI_CLIENT_ID` ("client profiles") which have
  been used. By default, the listing is restricted to the current environment. A
  hidden option (`--all`) can be used to list all environments

== 3.1.4 (2021-11-09)

Bugfixes:

* `globus session consent` was reducing the scopes of the Auth token provided
  by login, resulting in errors on `logout` and `whoami`

== 3.1.3 (2021-11-05)

Enhancements:

* The `--help` text for `globus endpoint create` now clarifies the meaning of `--personal`.
* Errors for use of mutually exclusive options to `globus endpoint create` have been improved.

Bugfixes:

* Fix an error when `globus ls --recursive` is used on an empty directory, or
  filtered such that a recursive listing has no results
* The help text printed by `--batch` when stdin is a tty has been removed. This
  text explained CLI v2.x behavior, and is not accurate for CLI v3.x
* Fix a bug in `globus session consent` in which an `id_token` was expected as
  part of the token data, but the `openid` scope was not provided to the login
  flow
* Fix a crash that occurs when running `globus task event-list {task-id}`

== 3.1.2 (2021-10-13)

Bugfixes:

* Fix a typo in the word "latitude" for `--location` arguments.
* Fix the handling of the legacy-line of `virtualenv`, versions below `20.0.0`.
  When the `globus-cli` was installed under these versions of `virtualenv`, all
  commands would fail at import-time due to an API difference between stdlib
  `site` module and the `virtualenv`-generated `site`

== 3.1.1 (2021-10-12)

Bugfixes:

* The behavior of `globus update` when operating under a `pipx` install has
  been fixed, so that `--user` will not be passed to the `pip` invocation
* Fix `TypeError` in `globus endpoint activate` resulting from the v3 upgrade

Other:

* Cleanup internal and undocumented behaviors of `globus update`

== 3.1.0 (2021-10-08)

Enhancements:

* Add the new `globus search` command group for interacting with the Globus
  Search service. `globus search` commands may prompt users to login again if
  they have not previously used a `globus search` command.
* Add the `globus search query` command for executing searches on Globus Search
  indices.
* Add the `globus search ingest` command for ingesting data into a Globus Search
  index. You must have `writer` permissions on the index in order to use this
  operation.
* Add the `globus search task show` and `globus search task list` commands. To
  use these commands, you must have `writer` permissions on the index whose
  tasks are being displayed.

Bugfixes:

* Fix `TypeError` when running `globus endpoint set-subscription-id`

== 3.0.2 (2021-10-06)

Bugfixes:

* `globus task cancel --all` no longer throws a TypeError.

== 3.0.1 (2021-09-29)

Bugfixes:

* Update dependency specification to avoid an issue in which old versions of
  `cryptography` were not updated when an existing installation was updated

== 3.0.0 (2021-09-29)

This is a major release of the CLI and has several backwards incompatible
changes. See the Backwards Incompatible Changes list below.

Bugfixes:

* Fix a bug in which some error outputs could be sent to stdout

Enhancements:

* `globus endpoint show` now includes the description field. Formatting of the
  description may wrap
* `globus session update` now supports domains for
  `session_required_single_domain` requirements
* globus-cli now uses more advanced token storage, and does not use
  `~/.globus.cfg`. A `globus login` with this version will invalidate any CLI
  tokens found in `~/.globus.cfg`
** Note: this version of the CLI will not modify the `~/.globus.cfg` file, only
   invalidate CLI version 2 tokens. After the upgrade, you may remove this file
   if you are not using it for other purposes.
* globus-cli now supports use of the `GLOBUS_PROFILE` environment variable,
  which lets users name sets of credentials and switch between accounts
* globus-cli commands can now direct the user to login to a specific Globus
  Connect Server v5 Endpoint. When the requirements for running a command are
  not met, a message with the correct login command will be shown.
* A new environment variable, `GLOBUS_CLI_INTERACTIVE` can be used to instruct the
  CLI to behave as though it is or is not in an interactive shell. Set
  `GLOBUS_CLI_INTERACTIVE=0` to force non-interactive behavior, and
  `GLOBUS_CLI_INTERACTIVE=1` to force interactive behavior
* Add new collection-related commands for Mapped and Guest Collections
** `globus collection list`
** `globus collection show`
** `globus collection update`
** `globus collection delete`
* `globus endpoint ...` and `globus collection ...` commands may exit with an
  error instructing the user to use a corresponding command when
  `globus endpoint` commands are used on collections or `globus collection`
  commands are used on non-collection endpoint types
* Add new `globus group list` command for listing your group memberships

Backwards Incompatible Changes:

* Remove the `--version` flag. Use `globus version` instead
* `globus endpoint server add` now takes the server as a positional argument, not
  a required option
* `globus rename` has changed to take the endpoint ID once and two separate paths,
  instead of two `endpoint:path` arguments which require the endpoint ID to match
* Remove the `globus config` commands
* `globus transfer --batch` and `globus delete --batch` now accept filenames to
  specify batches. To use stdin (as in v2), pass a single dash for the filename,
  as in `--batch -`
* Two new exit statuses, in addition to 0, 1, and 2, are now used by the CLI to
  indicate specific error conditions
** An `exit(3)` is used whenever the type of an object does not match the
   expectations of a command. For example, `globus collection list` on a
   Collection is incorrect -- that command should be used on Endpoints
** An `exit(4)` is used whenever the authentication or authorization
   requirements of a command are not met. For example, if your session does not
   satisfy the `authentication_timeout` for an HA endpoint.

== 2.1.0 (2021-06-23)

Enhancements:

* Drop support for python2

== 1.16.0 (2021-01-29)

Enhancements:

* `globus transfer` now supports two new flags, `--skip-source-errors` and
  `--fail-on-quota-errors`, which allow you to better control error behaviors

* `globus task show --skipped-errors` is a new flag which will show skipped
  transfer errors (for transfers which support them)

== 1.15.0 (2021-01-28)

Bugfixes:

* The `disable_verify` option will no longer be set to `False` when left
  unspecified in `globus endpoint update`

Enhancements:

* `globus update` now restricts updates to python2-compatible versions when
  running under python2

== 1.13.0 (2020-04-28)

Enhancements:

* Add a new command, `globus endpoint set-subscription-id`, which allows
  Subscription Managers to set the subscription on Endpoints where they may
  not have administrative privileges

== 1.12.0 (2020-03-12)

Bugfixes:

* If a new `refresh_token` is issued when a token refreshes, it will be stored
  correctly.

* Paths being joined for `--batch` mode for `globus transfer` and
  `globus delete` on Windows were joined incorrectly with the platform path
  separator (`\`). They are now joined correctly with `/`

Enhancements:

* Error and hint outputs are styled using colors when the output is being
  written to a terminal.

  ** Supports macOS and Linux by default using ANSI colors.

  ** You can install colorama (`pip install colorama`) in the same
     environment as the CLI to get color support on Windows.

* Endpoints whose activation requirements do not include any myproxy
  requirements now give an informative error message if myproxy activation is
  attempted

* Add support for `--external-checksum` and `--checksum-algorithm` in
  `globus transfer` commands

Other:

* Internally, use the `globus_sdk.IdentityMap` construct, not a custom mapping type.

* Remove official support for python3.4, add support for python3.8

* Improvements to help text

== 1.11.0 (2019-08-13)

# Here you can customize the remote and commit in case you don't want Linus
# Torvalds' mainline.
# For security reasons, the remote's prefix is hardcoded and you can only
# select among the git.kernel.org's official development trees (although this
# package uses a faster mirror):
# https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/${REMOTE}

# These are the default values if none is selected:
# REMOTE="torvalds/linux"
# COMMIT="master"

# This is an example if v5.17.7 stable is to be used
# REMOTE="stable/linux"
# COMMIT="v5.17.7"

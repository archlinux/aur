Subject: [PATCH] Exclude qmltime when cross compiling

as the build script would attempt to set the property of a target
which does not exist (leading to a configuration error).

This tool seems not really requird and is already disabled when
compiling for Android or when compiling static libraries anyways.
That's likely also why upstream did not notice this problem so far.

Subject: util/mkimage: Fix wrong PE32+ section sizes for some arches

The commit f60ba9e5945 (util/mkimage: Refactor section setup to use a helper)
added a helper function to setup PE sections. But it also changed how the
raw data offsets were calculated since all the section sizes are aligned.
However, for some platforms, i.e ia64-efi and arm64-efi, the kernel image
size is not aligned using the section alignment. This leads to the situation
in which the mods section offset in its PE section header does not match its
real placement in the PE file. So, finally the GRUB is not able to locate
and load built-in modules.

The problem surfaces on ia64-efi and arm64-efi because both platforms
require additional relocation data which is added behind .bss section.
So, we have to add some padding behind this extra data to make the
beginning of mods section properly aligned in the PE file. Fix it by
aligning the kernel_size to the section alignment. That makes the sizes
and offsets in the PE section headers to match relevant sections in the
PE32+ binary file.

In order to boot with the archiso image a new loader must be added to
ESP/loader/entries/, this must be done manually as the UUID of the ESP
partition must be set in the loader. There is an example in
/usr/share/doc/archiso-systemd-boot where the text esp-uuid must be changed
to the corresponding UUID.

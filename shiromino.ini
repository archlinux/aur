# FRAME_DELAY controls the number of milliseconds to delay after drawing frames, if VSync is off.
# For "good enough" behavior that balances between low CPU usage and responsiveness, it's best to
# set it to values close to your monitor's refresh rate. Though, you can set it high enough to make
# the game run at a reduced frame rate with more lag, and reduced CPU usage.
#
# For 60 Hz, 16 or 17 is suggested, assuming the game's gameplay and graphics aren't taking much
# time on your system. Setting it to 0 will basically disable the delay between drawing frames,
# increasing CPU usage significantly (it basically takes up 100% CPU usage of one core), but has
# less lag and more consistent and accurate game frame timing.

#
# The interpolation tries to keep the upscaled screen as close as possible to looking pixelated,
# rather than just blurry. Keep in mind that this does increase system requirements when enabled,
# and forces all graphics to use OpenGL, rather than the default SDL2 graphics API for your
# platform, which would be DirectX on Windows.

# will ensure behavior much like the original games' hardware. Using this setting is strongly
# discouraged for setting records if your display's refresh rate differs from the mode you're
# trying to get records in.
#
# If you're not sure if you should use this setting, you almost certainly shouldn't. But, since

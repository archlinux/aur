# Plugins extend NfSen for the purpose of: 
# Periodic data processing, alerting-condition and alerting-action
# For data processing a plugin may run for any profile or for a specific profile only.

#                           or '*' for any profile, '!' for no profile
#            module:        Perl Module name, equal to plugin name 
# The profile list '!' make sense for plugins, which only provide alerting functions
#
# The module follows the standard Perl module conventions, with at least one
# function: Init(). See demoplugin.pm for a simple template.
#
# A file with the same name in the FRONTEND_PLUGINDIR and .php extension is automatically
# recongized as frontend plugin.

######################################################
#
# Nfsen Simulator
# The simulator requires, that you have already installed
# and configured NfSen. The simulation is based on already
# pre-colleted data, which you may get from another live 
# NfSen system.
# 
# Steps to setup the NfSen simulator:
# 1. Configure the sources of the live profile with the 
#    same names of the NfSen system, you take netflow data
#    for the simulation. Set the port for each netflow source
#    to 0 to prevent a collector to be started.
#    Install NfSen with this config in a seperate directory
# 2. Copy the pre-collected data into the appropriate 
#    netflow directory of the live profile.
# 3. Configure the simulator using the parameters below
#    Enable Simulation mode => $SIMmode = 1
#    Configure the time window of the pre-collected data.
#      tstart    => Start of time window. yyyymmddhhmm
#      tbegin    => Optional parameter. Start of simulation 
#                   profile exists already between tstart - tbegin
#      tend      => End of time window. yyyymmddhhmm
#      cycletime => simulation time in seconds of a 5min slot
#    Setting cycletime = 0 processes the cycles as fast as
#    possible. Please note, if you test plugings, your 
#    cycletime needs to be at least the time required to 
#    process all plugins.
# 4. Start nfsen: ../nfsen start
#    Simulation starts
#
# The simulator runs from tstart to tend and stops when tend
# is reached. You may stop the simulation at any given time
# using ./nfsen stop. To continue the simulation start NfSen
# again: ./nfsen start. You may reset the simulator at any
# given time using ./nfsen abort-reset. This stops the sumulation
# and rolls back to tstart. All profiles/alerts are deleted,
# so you may start from scratch again.
#
# Configure simulator parameters
#
# $SIMmode = 1;
# %sim = (
#    'tstart'     => '200707100000',	# Simulation data available from July 10th 2007 00:00
#    'tbegin'     => '200707110000',	# Simulation begins at July 11th 2007 00:00
#    'tend'       => '200707112355',	# Simulation ends at July 11th 2007 23:55
#    'cycletime'  => '30',				# 30s per 5min slot

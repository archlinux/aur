+.SH NAME
+wordplay \- anagram finder
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B wordplay string [\-slxavnmd] [\-w word] [\-f wordfile]
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.B wordplay
+is an anagram finder. What is an anagram?  Well, let's turn to
+Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition:
+.IP anagram:
+a word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another word or phrase.
+.PP
+Each letter in the anagram must appear with the same frequency as in the
+original string.
+.PP
+For example, the letters in the word "stop" can be rearranged to spell
+"tops" or "pots" or "sotp".  "sotp" is not a word and is not of interest
+when generating anagrams.  "stop" has four letters, so there are 24 ways
+to rearrange its letters.  However, very few of the rearrangements actually
+spell words.
+.PP
+Wordplay, by using a list of words, takes a specified string of letters and
+uses the list of words to find anagrams of the string.
+.PP
+By the way, "Wordplay" anagrams to "Rowdy Pal", and the program really can
+live up to that particular anagram.  I have been able to come up with
+anagrams of most of my coworkers' names that are humorous, descriptive,
+satirical, or, occasionally, quite vulgar.
+.SH OPTIONS
+.IP string
+String to be anagrammed.  This should be seen to the program \fBas a
+single argument\fP.  If you feel you must put spaces in the string, under
+UNIX, you will have to put backslashes in front of the spaces or just put
+the entire string in double quotes.  Just leave the spaces out because the
+program throws them out anyway.
+.IP -s
+Silent operation.  If this option is used, the header and line
+numbers are not printed.  This is useful if you want the output to
+contain only the anagrams.  Use this option with the l (and x) option
+to generate a wordlist which can be piped or redirected.
+This option does not suppress error messages that are printed to
+stderr.  Finding zero anagrams is not an error.
+.IP -l
+Print list of candidate words before anagramming.  This is the list of
+words that can be spelled with the letters from the specified string,
+with no letters being used more often that they appear in the input
+string.
+.IP -x
+Do not perform anagramming.  Use with l if you just want the
+candidate word list without anagrams.
+.IP -a
+Allow anagrams containing two or more occurrences of a word.
+.IP -v
+Consider strings with no vowels as candidate words and do not give
+up when there are no vowels remaining after extractions.
+.IP -m
+Limit candidate word length to a maximum number of letters.
+Follow by an integer.  m12 means limit words to 12 letters.
+m5 means limit them to 5 letters.
+.IP -n
+Limit candidate word length to a minimum number of letters.
+Follow by an integer.  n2 means limit words to 2 letters.
+n11 means limit them to 11 letters.
+.IP -d
+Limit number of words in anagrams to a maximum number.
+Follow by an integer.  d3 means no anagrams should contain more
+than 3 words.  d12 means limit anagrams to 12 words.  This is
+currently the option that I recommend to limit output, since
+an optimization has been added to speed execution in some cases
+when this option is used.
+.IP -w
+Specify a word which should appear in all anagrams.  This is useful
+if you already have a word in mind that you want in the anagrams.
+This option should be specified at the end of the command, followed
+by a space and the word to use.
+.IP -f
+Specify which word list to use.  See example!  This option should
+be specified at the end of the command, followed by a space and the
+alternate wordfile name.  This is useful if you have other word lists
+to try or if you are interested in making your own customized word
+list.
+New feature:  Use a hyphen as the filename if the wordlist should
+be read from stdin.
+.SH EXAMPLES
+.IP "wordplay persiangulf"
+Anagram the string "persiangulf" .
+.IP "wordplay anagramming -lx"
+Print the list of words from the wordlist that can be spelled by using
+the letters from the word "anagramming".  A letter may not be used more
+often than the number of times it occurs in the word "anagramming".
+No anagrams are generated.
+.IP "wordplay tomservocrow -n3m8"
+Anagram the string "tomservocrow" .  Do not use words shorter than
+3 letters or longer than 8 letters.
+.IP "wordplay persiangulf -ld3m10 -f /usr/share/dict/words"
+Print the candidate words for the string "persiangulf".
+Print anagrams containing up to 3 words, without considering any
+words longer than 10 characters.  Use the file "/usr/share/dict/words"
+rather than "words721.txt".
+.IP "wordplay soylentgreen -n3w stolen -f w2"
+Print anagrams of "soylentgreen" containing the word "stolen" and
+use the file "w2" as the wordlist file.  Discard candidate words
+shorter than 3 characters.
+.IP "wordplay university -slx"
+Print the candidate word list for the string "university".  The
+output will consist of just the words.  This output is more useful
+for redirecting to a file or for piping to another program.
+.IP "wordplay trymeout -s"
+Anagram the string "trymeout" and print the anagrams with no line
+numbers.  The header will not be printed.  This is useful for piping
+the output to another process (or saving it to a file to be used
+by another program) without having to parse the output to remove the
+numbers and header.
+.IP "wordplay trymeout -v"
+Anagram "trymeout" as usual, but in case vowel-free strings are in
+the wordlist, consider them as possible candidate words.
+.IP "cat wordlist1 wordlist2 wordlist3 | sort -u | wordplay trymeout -f -"
+Anagram "trymeout" and read the wordlist from stdin, so that, in
+this case, the three wordlists "wordlist1", "wordlist2",
+and "wordlist3" will be concatenated and piped into
+.B wordplay
+as the wordlist.  The "sort -u" is there to remove duplicate words
+from the combined wordlist.
+.SH NOTES
+If the option specifiers are combined, as in "an7m7d5f" or "d3n5f", the f
+should come last, followed by a space and the word list file.
+.PP
+The "w" option is used in the same manner.
+.PP
+Limit the number of words to consider, if desired, using the n and m
+options, or better yet, use the d option to limit depth, when anagramming
+certain time-consuming strings.  The program is currently optimized to speed
+execution in some cases when the d option is used.
+.PP
+It is highly recommended that the "words721.txt" file distributed with the program be
+used, since many nonsense two and three-letter combinations that are not
+words have been eliminated.  This makes the quality of the output slightly
+better and speeds execution of the program a slight bit.  Any word list may
+be used, as long as there is one word per line.  Feel free to create your
+own custom word list and use it instead.  The word list does not have to be
+sorted in any particular way.

+.SH DISTRIBUTION
+This program was written for fun and is free.  Distribute it as you please,
+but please distribute the entire package, with the original words721.txt and
+the readme file.  If you modify the code, please mention my name in it as
+the original author.  Please send me a copy of improvements you make, because I
+may include them in a future version.

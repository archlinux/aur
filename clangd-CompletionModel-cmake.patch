Subject: [PATCH] Make clangd CompletionModel usable even with non-standard
 (but supported) layout

llvm supports specifying a non-standard layout where each project lies in its
own place. Do not assume a fixed layout and use the appropriate cmake variable
instead.

Subject: [PATCH] Make clangd CompletionModel not depend on directory layout.

The current code accounts for two possible layouts, but there is at
least a third supported layout: clang-tools-extra may also be checked
out as clang/tools/extra with the releases, which was not yet handled.
Rather than treating that as a special case, use the location of
CompletionModel.cmake to handle all three cases. This should address the
problems that prompted D96787 and the problems that prompted the
proposed revert D100625.

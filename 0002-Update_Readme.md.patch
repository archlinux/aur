+Game resources
+--------------
+To start the game, you'll need the original resurces of a licensed copy of Serious Sam: The First Encounter and Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.
+
+### Steam version. 
+If you have a digital copy of the game on Steam then the resources can be found in 
+~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Serious Sam Classic The Second Encounter/ (the default Steam game installation directory on Linux).
+The program will find these resources itself
+
+### GOG version.
+If you bought a digital on GOG, you can unpack the resources with the innoextract CLI tool. To install innoextract via your package manager, run:
+
+```
+sudo apt-get install innoextract
+```
+Copy files "setup_serious_sam_the_first_encounter_2.0.0.10.exe" and "setup_serious_sam_the_second_encounter_2.1.0.8.exe" 
+to a home directory and run the following commands:
+
+```
+cd ~/.
+innoextract --gog setup_serious_sam_the_first_encounter_2.0.0.10.exe
+mv app samtfe
+innoextract --gog setup_serious_sam_the_second_encounter_2.1.0.8.exe
+mv app samtse
+```
+After launching the program and installing the game data, you can delete it.
+```
+rm setup_serious_sam_the_first_encounter_2.0.0.10.exe
+rm setup_serious_sam_the_first_encounter_2.0.0.10.exe
+rm -rf samtfe
+rm -rf samtse
+```
+### Physical  version.
+If you bought a physical copy of the game and you have an ISO of your disk, you can unpack the resources with the any archive manager. 
+Game resources are located in the **Install** directory of the disk. Just copy all content from there to home directories.
+
+Possible problems and their solutions
+-------------------------------------
+When you first start the game, it is possible that the monsters will be frozen (will not move). This is not due to the Serious Runner, but to the fact that the level is launched from the command line. The solution is very simple. You need to stop the game, launch any game level from the menu for 1-2 seconds and exit the game. The game will overwrite the configuration file and the next game starts will be fine.
+
+If you have a lot of files in your home directory, then searching for game data after clicking the "Search and install game data" button may take some time. Just be patient. In the usual case, it takes 2-3 seconds.

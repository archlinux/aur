Subject: [PATCH] mei: hbm: drop capability response on early shutdown

commit 68553650bc9c57c7e530c84e5b2945e9dfe1a560 upstream.

Drop HBM responses also in the early shutdown phase where
the usual traffic is allowed.
Extend the rule that drop HBM responses received during the shutdown
phase by also in MEI_DEV_POWERING_DOWN state.
This resolves the stall if the driver is stopping in the middle
of the link initialization or link reset.

Drop the capabilities response on early shutdown.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.24.0

- **BREAKING**: Removed legacy `~/.agents.config.json` config file support. Nanocoder no longer checks the home directory for a dot-prefixed config file. If you are still using this path, move your config to the platform-specific directory: `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/agents.config.json` (macOS), `~/.config/nanocoder/agents.config.json` (Linux), or `%APPDATA%\nanocoder\agents.config.json` (Windows).

- **BREAKING**: Removed legacy `~/.nanocoder-preferences.json` preferences file support. Preferences are now only loaded from the platform-specific directory (e.g. `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/nanocoder-preferences.json` on macOS) or a project-level `nanocoder-preferences.json` in your working directory. To migrate, move your existing file: `mv ~/.nanocoder-preferences.json ~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/nanocoder-preferences.json`

- **BREAKING**: Removed deprecated array format for MCP server configuration. Only the object format is now supported: `{ "mcpServers": { "serverName": { ... } } }`. If you are using the array format in `.mcp.json`, convert each array entry to an object key using the server name.

- **BREAKING**: Removed `agents.config.json` fallback for MCP server loading. Global MCP servers must now be configured in `~/.config/nanocoder/.mcp.json` (Linux), `~/Library/Preferences/nanocoder/.mcp.json` (macOS), or `%APPDATA%\nanocoder\.mcp.json` (Windows). Provider configuration still uses `agents.config.json`.

- **BREAKING**: Removed `auth` and `reconnect` fields from MCP server configuration. The `auth` field was never functional (both HTTP and WebSocket transports logged warnings that it was unsupported). The `reconnect` field was never implemented. Use `headers` for HTTP authentication instead (e.g. `"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer $TOKEN" }`).

- Added `/resume` command for restoring previous chat sessions. Sessions are automatically saved and can be resumed from an interactive selector. Sessions are filtered by the current project directory by default, with an `--all` flag to show all sessions. Thanks to @yashksaini-coder.

- Added `--provider` and `--model` CLI flags for non-interactive provider and model specification, allowing CI/CD scripts and automation to skip the setup wizard. Closes #394. Thanks to @james2doyle.

- Added `NANOCODER_PROVIDERS` environment variable support for configuring providers without config files, useful for Docker containers and CI environments. Closes #307. Thanks to @kaustubha07.

- Added GitHub Copilot as a provider template with OAuth device flow authentication and `/copilot-login` command. Thanks to @yashksaini-coder.

- Added MLX Server provider template for local Apple Silicon inference. Closes #318.

- Added parallel tool execution allowing the model to run multiple independent tool calls concurrently for faster task completion.

- Added compact mode toggle via `Ctrl+L` in chat input to collapse the conversation view.

- Added VS Code fork support for IDE integration (Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, etc.). Thanks to @kapsner.

- Added Aurora Borealis theme.

- Added notice when the model falls back to XML tool calls, informing users they can switch to a model with native tool calling support.

- Adopted AI SDK human-in-the-loop pattern for tool approval. Tool confirmation now uses the SDK's built-in `tool-approval-request`/`tool-approval-response` flow instead of manual tool-call splitting, improving reliability and reducing code complexity.

- Simplified tool processing by removing double XML parsing and the JSON tool call parser. Tool call parsing now happens in a single place and only on the XML fallback path for non-tool-calling models.

- Restructured documentation into a Nextra-compatible `docs/` folder structure with nested sections for getting-started, configuration, and features. The README is now a concise landing page linking to the full docs.

- Refactored app-utils into focused handler files, extracted shared utilities, unified mode state, and stubbed commands for cleaner architecture.

- Fix: `alwaysAllow` field in MCP server configuration was silently dropped during config loading due to a missing field mapping. MCP tools configured with `alwaysAllow` now correctly skip confirmation prompts as documented.

- Fix: Provider timeouts are now respected in non-interactive mode. Thanks to @kaustubha07. Closes #402.

- Fix: Non-interactive mode no longer exits prematurely when the prompt or response contains the word "error".

- Fix: Invalid CLI arguments no longer trigger the setup wizard. Thanks to @james2doyle.

- Fix: Installation detector no longer falsely reports Homebrew on macOS when `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` is set but Nanocoder was installed via npm. Closes #392.

- Fix: Preserve draft message when navigating through history with arrow keys.

- Fix: `fetch_url` display now truncates to fit terminal width.

- Fix: Validation failures no longer incorrectly prompt for tool confirmation.

- Fix: Various error message and `execute_bash` formatter improvements.

- Fix: Safe process metrics refactored into shared module to prevent duplicate declarations. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Security: Package audit failures resolved.

- Dependency updates: `ai` 6.0.116, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.58, `@ai-sdk/google` 3.0.33, `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` 2.0.30, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.27.1, `undici` 7.24.0, `cheerio` 1.2.0, `dotenv` 17.3.1, `wrap-ansi` 10.0.0.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder.

# 1.23.0

- Added `ask_user` tool for interactive question prompts. The LLM can now present the user with a question and selectable options during a conversation, returning their answer to guide the next step. Uses a global question-queue to bridge the tool's suspended Promise with the Ink UI component.

- Added per-project cron scheduler for running AI tasks on a schedule. Schedule files live in `.nanocoder/schedules/` as markdown prompts with YAML frontmatter, managed via the `/schedule` command (`create`, `add`, `remove`, `list`, `logs`, `start`). Includes cron expression parsing, sequential job queue with deduplication, dedicated scheduler mode with auto-accept, and run history logging.

- Added centralized graceful shutdown system. A `ShutdownManager` now coordinates cleanup of all services (VS Code server, MCP client, LSP manager, health monitor, logger) on exit, preventing orphaned child processes and dangling connections. Configurable via `NANOCODER_DEFAULT_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` env variable. Closes #239.

- Added file operation tools: `delete_file`, `move_file`, `create_directory`, and `copy_file`. Reorganized existing file tools into a `file-ops/` directory group.

- Added readline keybind support to text input. Replaces `ink-text-input` with a custom `TextInput` component supporting Ctrl+W (delete word), Ctrl+U (kill to start), Ctrl+K (kill to end), Ctrl+A/E (jump to start/end), and Ctrl+B/F (move char). Closes #354.

- Added `/context-max` command and `NANOCODER_CONTEXT_LIMIT` env variable for manual context length override on models not listed on models.dev. Resolution order: session override > env variable > models.dev > null. Closes #379.

- Added `/ide` command matching the `--vscode` flag for toggling VS Code integration from within a session.

- Added persistent context percentage display in the mode indicator, replacing the previous context checker component.

- Added `include` and `path` parameters to `search_file_contents` tool for scoping searches to specific file patterns and directories.

- Added Kanagawa theme.

- Refactored the skills system into custom commands, eliminating redundant parsers, loaders, and test suites. Commands gain optional skill-like fields (`tags`, `triggers`, `estimated-tokens`, `resources`) for auto-injection and relevance scoring. The `/skills` command is removed and its functionality absorbed into `/commands` with new subcommands (`show`, `refresh`). Thanks to @yashksaini-coder for the initial skills implementation in PR #370.

- V2 type-safe tool system overhaul with defensive parsing. Implements a three-tiered defense system for handling chaotic LLM outputs, preventing crashes from non-string responses and enabling robust self-correction. Includes universal type safety with `ensureString()`, response normalization, confidence system inversion, ghost echo deduplication, and AI SDK contract fixes. Local LLM experience is now significantly more stable. Thanks to @cleyesode. Closes #362.

- Fix: XML parser now uses optimistic matching for consistency with the JSON parser. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Fix: Bash tool now emits progress immediately on stdout/stderr data instead of waiting for the 500ms timer, so fast-completing commands show streaming output.

- Fix: Recognize `127.0.0.1` as a local server URL and tighten error classification. Ollama users configuring `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` no longer experience misleading connection errors. Replaced broad `connect` substring match with specific error codes to prevent misclassifying "disconnect"/"reconnect". Closes #366.

- Fix: Skip loading git tools when not inside a git repository.

- Fix: Strip ANSI escape codes before running regex matching in tool formatters.

- Fix: Gap in layout during auto-compact.

- Fix: Hardened `write_file` validation and MCP client type safety.

- Fix: Use local `TextInput` component instead of the missing `ink-text-input` package.

- Fix(mcp): Use Python-based `mcp-server-fetch` instead of non-existent npm package.

- Security: Semgrep and audit fixes.

- Dependency updates: `ai` 6.0.95, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.46, `@ai-sdk/google` 3.0.30, `undici` 7.22.0, `sonic-boom` 4.2.1.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.22.5

- Added MiniMax Coding Plan and GLM-5 to provider templates in the configuration wizard.

- Fix: Model context limit lookups now use models.dev as the primary source instead of the hardcoded fallback table. This prevents stale hardcoded values from overriding accurate upstream data. The hardcoded table remains as an offline-only fallback. Also fixes greedy key matching where shorter keys like `mixtral` would match before `mixtral:8x22b`, and replaces first-match name lookups with scored matching for more accurate results.

- Fix: Binary and excessively large files tagged with `@` no longer pollute the LLM context window with unreadable content.

- Fix: Diff preview panel no longer steals terminal focus from the active input.

- Fix: Reduced verbosity of the `string_replace` error formatter output.

- Fix: Reject null and non-object arguments in JSON tool calls, preventing formatter crashes from malformed tool call arguments. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Fix: Restored `formatError` usage for validation and execution errors.

- Dependency updates: `ink-gradient` 4.0.0, `react` 19.2.4, `@nanocollective/get-md` 1.1.1, `@ai-sdk/anthropic` 3.0.43, `pino` 10.3.1, `@types/react` 19.2.14.

# 1.22.4

- Security: Tool validators now run inside the AI SDK's auto-execution loop. Previously, tools with `needsApproval: false` (like `read_file`) were auto-executed by the AI SDK's `generateText` without any path validation, allowing the model to read or write files outside the project directory using absolute or `~` paths. Validators are now wrapped into each tool's `execute` function at registration time, ensuring validation runs in all code paths.

- Security: Reject home directory shorthand (`~`) in file path validation. Paths starting with `~` are not expanded by Node.js and could bypass project boundary checks.

- Fix: Tab characters in code blocks within assistant messages now render at 2-space width instead of the terminal default of 8 spaces. This prevents long lines from wrapping prematurely and eliminates the blocky visual effect on messages containing indented code.

- Fix: `normalizeIndentation` no longer short-circuits when the minimum indent is 0. Previously, if any line in the context window had zero indentation, raw tab characters passed through to the terminal unchanged, rendering at 8-space width in `string_replace` diff previews.

# 1.22.3

- Fix: Removed tool call deduplication from JSON parser that silently dropped duplicate tool calls, breaking the 1:1 pairing between tool calls and results expected by AI SDK. This caused "Tool result is missing for tool call" errors that would end the agent's turn prematurely. Consolidated three overlapping regex patterns into a single comprehensive pattern to prevent duplicate matches. Thanks to @cleyesode.

- Fix: Added missing capture group for arguments in the consolidated JSON tool call regex pattern, which caused inline tool calls to have empty arguments instead of actual parsed values.

- Fix: When the model batched read-only and write tools in a single response (e.g. `read_file` + `string_replace`), the auto-executed read tools would recurse into the next conversation turn, abandoning the confirmation-needed write tools. This left orphaned `tool_use` blocks without matching `tool_result` entries, triggering intermittent "Tool result is missing for tool call" errors with the Anthropic provider.

- Dependency updates: `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` 2.0.27, `undici` 7.21.0, `@biomejs/biome` 2.3.14, `@types/vscode` 1.109.0, `@types/node` 25.2.1.

# 1.22.2

- Fix: Markdown tables in assistant messages were rendered at full terminal width instead of accounting for the message box border and padding, causing broken box-drawing characters when lines wrapped.

# 1.22.1

- Added native Anthropic SDK support via `@ai-sdk/anthropic` package. The Anthropic Claude provider template now uses `sdkProvider: 'anthropic'` for direct API integration instead of the OpenAI-compatible wrapper.

- Fixed Kimi Code provider template to use the native `@ai-sdk/anthropic` SDK with correct base URL and configuration passthrough.

- Fix: User message token count now reflects the full assembled content including pasted content and tagged file contents, instead of only counting the placeholder text.

- Fix: Removed aggressive tool call deduplication that silently dropped duplicate tool call IDs and identical function signatures. This could cause "Tool result is missing for tool call" errors with providers like Anthropic that strictly validate tool call/result pairing.

# 1.22.0

- Added `/explorer` command for interactive file browsing with tree view navigation, file preview with syntax highlighting, multi-file selection, search mode, and VS Code integration. Closes #298.

- Added task management tools (`create_task`, `list_tasks`, `update_task`, `delete_task`) with `/tasks` slash command for models to track and manage progress on complex work. Tasks persist in `.nanocoder/tasks.json` and are automatically cleared on CLI boot and `/clear` command.

- Added `/settings` command for interactive command menu to configure UI theme and shapes without editing config files directly.

- Added `sdkProvider` configuration option for native Google Gemini support. This fixes the "missing thought_signature" error with Gemini 3 models by using the `@ai-sdk/google` package. Closes #302.

- Added custom headers support in provider configuration. This enables authentication through tunnels like Cloudflare. Thanks to @nicolalamacchia.

- Added Kimi Code provider template in configuration wizard.

- Added new themes with updated user input and user message styling for better visual clarity and consistency.

- Added token count display after messages and completion message to provide visibility into context usage throughout conversations.

- Refactored git tools for better consistency, improved error handling, standardized parameter handling across all git operations, and enhanced user feedback messages.

- Added line truncation in `write_file` and `string_replace` formatters to prevent excessive output from files with very long lines and neaten user experience on narrow terminals.

- Fix: `/usage` command crash when context data is unavailable.

- Fix: String replace error handling for edge cases.

- Fix: Multiple security audit issues resolved.

- Fix: Various styling improvements across components.

- Fix: Dependency lockfile issues resolved.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.21.0

- Added `/compact` command for context compression with `--restore` flag support to restore messages from backup. The command now includes auto-compact functionality, consistent token counting, and improved compression for very long messages. Thanks to @Pahari47.

- Added hierarchical configuration loading for both provider configs and MCP servers. Local project configurations now properly override global settings, and Claude Code's object-style MCP configuration format is now supported. Thanks to @Avtrkrb.

- Added `alwaysAllow` configuration option for MCP servers to auto-approve trusted tools without confirmation prompts. Thanks to @namar0x0309.

- Fixed `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency version to resolve npm audit security issue.

- Fixed TLS certificate errors when using `uvx` MCP servers behind corporate proxies. Nanocoder now automatically adds `--native-tls` to uvx commands to use system certificates instead of rustls.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.20.3

- Fixed `search_file_contents` returning excessive tokens by truncating long matching lines to 300 characters. Previously, searching in files with long lines (minified JS, base64 data, etc.) could return ~100k tokens for just 30 matches.

- Added validation to `read_file` to reject minified/binary files (lines >10,000 characters). These files consume excessive tokens without providing useful information to the model. Use `metadata_only=true` to still check file properties.

- Fixed `web_search` result count display showing mismatched values (e.g., "10 / 5 results"). The formatter now correctly uses the same default as the search execution.

- Improved `web_search` and `fetch_url` formatter layouts to match `execute_bash` style with consistent column alignment and spacing.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

# 1.20.2

- Added preview generation to git workflow tools (`git-status-enhanced`, `git-smart-commit`, `git-create-pr`) showing results before execution.

- Fixed `string-replace` line number display in result mode - now correctly shows line numbers of new content after replacement.

- Added hammer icon (⚒) to git tool formatters for visual consistency.

- Improved formatting in `bash-progress`, `execute-bash`, and `read-file` tools with better spacing and layout.

- Simplified `string-replace` validation logic and removed redundant success messages.

- Fix: Running `/init --force` added duplication to `AGENTS.md`.

# 1.16.4

- Decouple config vs data directories to introduce clear separation between configuration and application data directories. Thanks to @bowmanjd pushing this update.

- Update checker now attempts to detect how you installed Nanocoder and uses that to update with CLI with. It all also presents, update steps to the user correctly to do manually. Thanks to @fabriziosalmi for doing this.

- Added Dracula theme.

- Fix: Command auto-complete would only work if there was just one command left to auto-complete to. Now whatever the top suggestion is is the one it autocompletes to.

- Fix: Improved paste detection to create placeholders for any pasted content (removed 80-char minimum), fixed consecutive paste placeholder sizing, paste chunking for VSCode and other terminals.

- Fix: Creating new lines in VSCode Terminal was broken. This has now been fixed.

# 1.16.3

- Fix: Update checker used old rendering method so it appeared broken and always checking for an update. This has now been resolved.

- Fix: Config files now correctly use `~/.config/nanocoder/` (or platform equivalents) instead of `~/.local/share/nanocoder/`, restoring proper XDG semantic separation between configuration and data. Thanks to @bowmanjd for patching this.

- Fix: Many edge-case fixes in the markdown parser for assistant messages. Outputs are far cleaner now.

- Removed message display limit, you can now see the entire session history. The message queue is very well optimised at this point so we can afford to.

- Removed `read_many_files` tool, it's rarely used by models over `read_file` and provides little benefit.

- Removed `search_files` tool as models often found it confusing for finding files and content.

_In replacement:_

- Added the `find_files` tool. The model provides a pattern and the tool returns matching files and directory paths.

- Added `search_file_contents` tool. The model provides a pattern and the tool returns matching content and metadata for further use.

- Revised `read_file` tool to reveal progressive information about a file. Called on its own, it'll return just file metadata, the model can also choose to pass line number ranges to get specific content.

- Update main prompt to reflect.

_^ All of the above is in effort to better manage context when it comes to models using tools. Some smaller models, like Qwen 3 Coder 30B struggle from intense context rot so these improvements are the first in a set that'll help small models make more accurate and purposeful tool calls._

# 1.16.2

- Fix: Models returning empty responses after tool execution now automatically reprompted.

- Fix: HTML tags in responses no longer trigger false tool call detection errors.

- `search_files` tool limited to 10 results (reduced from 50) to prevent large outputs
- `execute_bash` output truncated to 2,000 chars (reduced from 4,000) and returns plain string.

- Model context limit tests updated to match actual implementation

# 1.16.1

- Fix: Removed postinstall hook that caused installation failures due to missing scripts directory in published package. Models.dev data is now fetched on first use instead of during installation.

# 1.16.0

- New `/usage` command! Visually see model context usage. Thanks to @spinualexandru for doing this. Closes issue #12. 🎉

- Added new models to the recommendations database.

- Fix: Model asked for permission to call tools that didn't exist. It now errors and loops back to the model to correct itself.

# 1.15.1

- Fix: Sometimes Ollama returns tool calls without IDs, this caused empty responses occassionally. If no ID is detected, we now generate one.

- Fix: Homebrew installer was not working correctly.

- Fix: Node version requirement is now 20+.

# 1.15.0

- Big: Switched backend architecture to use AI SDK over LangGraph. This is a better fit for Nanocoder for many reasons. Thanks to @DenizOkcu for doing this switch.

- Tag files and their contents into messages directly use the `@` symbol. Nanocoder will fuzzy search and allow to choose which files.

- New message streaming to see agent respond in realtime. Toggle stream mode on and off via the `/streaming` command.

- Added Homebrew installation option.

- Improved command auto-complete by adding fuzzy search.

- Improved table rendering in CLI by switching out the custom renderer for the more robust `cli-table3` library.

- Improved non-native tool call parsing by refining the XML/JSON parsing flow.

# 1.14.3

- Added Nix package installation option. Thanks to @Lalit64 for closing issue #75.
- Chore: bumped `get-md` package version to the latest.

## 1.14.2

- Fix: issue #71. Markdown tables and HTML entities are now rendering properly in model responses.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.14.1

- Switched out Jina.ai that fetched LLM optimised markdown from URLs to our own, on-device, private Nano Collective package: [get-md](https://github.com/Nano-Collective/get-md).
- `search_files` tool now ignores contents of `.gitignore` over just a pre-defined set of common ignores.
- If you use OpenRouter as a provider, it now logs "Nancoder" as the agent.
- Fix: Added `parallel_tool_calls` to be equal to `false` in the LangGraph client. This helps bring some stability and flow to models especially when editing files.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.14.0

- Added `/setup-config` command - an interactive wizard for configuring LLM providers and MCP servers with built-in templates for popular services. Includes real-time validation, manual editing support (Ctrl+E), and automatic configuration reload.
- Revamped testing setup to now:
  - Check formatting with Prettier
  - Check types with tsc
  - Check for linting errors with Eslint
  - Run AVA tests
  - Test for unnused code and dependencies with Knip
- The full test suite passes for version 1.14.0 with no errors or warnings. Nanocoder should feel and work more robustly than ever!

## 1.13.9

- Added Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5 to model database.
- UI updates to welcome message, status and user input placeholder on narrow terminals.
- Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `pull_request_template.md` to reflect new testing requirements.
- Fix: Declining a tool suggestion and then sending a follow up message caused an error.
- Fix: Removed duplicate `hooks` directories and consolidated into one.
- Fix: Removed unneccessary `ollama` package.

## 1.13.8

- Fix: Issue #55
- Rolling out testing to the release pipeline

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.13.7

- Updated `LICENSE.md` to be `MIT License with Attribution`. This was done to keep the spirit of MIT but also ensure the technology built by contributors is properly credited.
- We added a new system prompt with better instructions, ordering, tool documentation and included system information.

  - Old system prompts are dated using the following format: `yyyy-mm-dd-main-prompt.md` where the date is when the prompt was retired.

- Fix: import aliases within the code now use `@/` syntax _without_ file extensions. This is an under-the-hood refactor to improve code readability and use more modern standards.
- Fix: All but the last message in the chat was made static through Ink. This still causes _some_ terminal flicker if the last message was a long one. All messages are immediately made static now to further improve performance.

If there are any problems, feedback or thoughts please drop an issue or message us through Discord! Thank you for using Nanocoder. 🙌

## 1.13.6

- Added `CHANGELOG.md` and rolled out changelogs to releases.
- Updated the `/clear` command output UI to read "Chat Cleared." over "✔️ Chat Cleared..."
- Refactored `langgraph-client.ts` to removed old methods that are no longer needed. Rolled out this change to `useChatHandler.tsx`. This results in smaller, more tidy files.
- Fix: LangGraph errors leaked through to UI display. This is now tidied to be from Nanocoder.
- Fix: Pressing Escape to cancel model responses was not instant and sometimes didn't work.

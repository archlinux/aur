**Download one of the binary files to use the font. You do not need the source.*

*The font works in all operating systems. It will show in color in many, but not all, applications. Refer to [Where can I use color fonts?](https://www.colorfonts.wtf/#section4) for details about your specific use case. Regular B&W outline emoji are included for backwards/fallback compatibility.*

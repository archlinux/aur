Version history
===============

0.10.12
-------

2023-06-19

Fix #375: Changing sound/music in the options menu will immediately play an
example sound or the menu music at the new volume setting. You don't have to
exit the options menu anymore to test.

Fix #466: When the next level is unplayable, e.g., it lacks hatches, you
can't run it from the next-level menu. Before, you could, and Lix crashed.

Added four boolean user options: With/without the tweaker, should air clicks
cancel the replay, and should new assignments insert or cut the replay?
Without the tweaker, the default remains that both air clicks and new
assignments cancel the replay. With the tweaker, by default, air clicks do
nothing and new assignments insert.

During play, the tooltip line is separate from the panel's info bar. Tooltips
appear over the play area and have a darkened background. I hope that new
players can now see easily: "Replaying. To play yourself, click into air."

Removed the zoom button from game and editor. Everybody zooms with the mouse
wheel, and the zoom button would zoom into the mouse cursor on the panel, thus
oddly fixing a point on the map outside the camera. For now, the game's
restart button is wider to cover the area of the old zoom button.

Revert mouse trapping to how it was in Lix 0.10.7 and earlier: We trap the
mouse already on mouseover when the Lix window is active.

Remove the steel tile matt/8x8. This tile had no nub, had no crossed metal
bars, and looked like geoo's concrete blocks which are earth. Remove it with
no replacement. We'll look separately at all levels that used it.

Won't Get Fooled Again: Replace important 8x8 steel with a nice-looking tile
group to make a steel staircase. Physics stay exactly the same.

All Aboard the Pain Train: Remove purely decorative 8x8 steel.

Sympathy for the Lix, Race to the Depths: Remove these multiplayer levels
with 8x8 steel. Sympathy relied on other players' mistakes. Race was too hard.

Removed an undocumented feature: You could place a file gain.txt into
music/ to change the volume of tracks.

Fixed compiler warnings from DMD 2.104.0: Change "in ref" to "in".



0.10.11
-------

2023-06-04

Offer a user option to choose the splat ruler's snapping distance.
Set this option to 0 to deactivate snapping altogether.

Make Lix compile again with D compilers older than DMD v2.102.0 from 2023-02.
In 0.10.10, I silently relied on a compiler bugfix that correctly allows
indexing associative arrays during @nogc; this needs DMD v2.102.0 or newer.



0.10.10
-------

2023-05-27

Fix #452: The search for the next unsolved level works again for when
the next unsolved level is not the next level. Before, from 0.10.6 through
0.10.9, the end-of-singleplayer screen showed only the next level.

Fix tooltips: When you hovered over a platformer or builder, the tooltip would
always instruct you to queue, even if you had, e.g., miner selected in the
skillbar. Now, the tooltip to queue appears only for the same selected skill.

Tweaker lines have white text when you hover over the corresponding lix.

When you erase an assignment via the tweaker, the tweaker will also erase
all assignments to the same lix in the same or a future physics update.

Add Kingshadow's Rescue Reduction, a new multiplayer map for 3 through 8
players that combines Rescue Rangers Double Team with Downward Reduction.



0.10.9
------

2023-05-01

Fix radio buttons: It was possible to select multiple radio buttons by
clicking the squares, not the labels. Now, only one button is ever active.

Add the 6 singleplayer levels from Lemmings Forums's Level Design Contest 27
by me and geoo in misc/contests/2023/: Bumper Cave, Inside Your Router,
Pommes Schranke, Rhizome, Hanabi, The Last Shall Be First.

Add Catalan translation of the Lix user interface.
Thanks for the translation, Rampoina!

Reduced the filesize of the SVG icon data/images/lix_logo.svg from 3.4 MB
to 30 KB. It looks practically the same. Thanks for re-tracing, Rampoina!

Allow longer description in the level editor's topology menu for wrap options.
Paint the size warning (level too large can crash 32-bit Lix) in red, possibly
overlapping the descriptions of the wrap checkboxes when both the description
and the warning texts are long.

Clarify "Alt+Tab is fast" in the options menu. Now the tooltip says:
"Switching windows (e.g., with Alt+Tab) works quickly."



0.10.8
------

2023-04-15

Don't re-trap the mouse cursor on mere mouseover after the mouse cursor has
left Lix. To re-trap, you must now click into Lix.

Added one singleplayer level, Cache Lines, in misc/simon/.

Link to the Fedora Lix package by Marcin ZajÄ…czkowski on Lix's main readme.
Thank you for packaging Lix for Fedora!

Switch documentation from HTTP to HTTPS weblinks wherever possible.
Thanks for the patch, Marcin!

Fixed the new compilation warnings from DMD 2.103.0: Deprecation: alias this
for classes/interfaces is deprecated. Now, Lix compiles without warnings
again, even with DMD 2.103.0.



0.10.7
------

2023-03-25

Fix #451: In the connection picker of the networking screen, the 3D outlines
of the buttons for IP address and ports were sometimes mispainted. Now, the
buttons are drawn correctly.

Radio button options, e.g., for screen mode, show a tooltip per possible choice
instead of a catch-all tooltip for the entire option.

Don't play music during player name entry on a fresh installation before
reaching the main menu. Play music only when we enter the main menu.
The music might be too loud or unexpected, and it's more obvious how to
exit from the main menu than from the player name entry screen.

Replace "No" with "Cancel" in two dialog boxes: Really delete this level?
Delete, Cancel. Really overwrite this level? Overwrite, Cancel.

Explain the command-line switches for screen modes in the main readme.

When you run Lix's unittests (`$ dub test`), the tests will scan all installed
languages in `./data/transl/` and print missing and unnecessary translations.
to stdout. Such translation issues do not abort or fail the unittests.
As before, Lix logs during play the missing and unnecessary translation lines
for your chosen language in the log file `./user/log.txt`.

Use handwritten recoloring code from magic pink to alpha transparency instead
of the Allegro 5 recoloring function, in hopes of avoiding #431: Magic pink
won't become transparent on macOS. I doubt that this fixes #431.



0.10.6
------

2023-02-04

Fix #453: Added a separate resolution user option (two integers) for hardware
fullscreen. Now, you can specify a windowed resolution and a hardware
resolution separately from each other. Before, the same setting applied
to both windowed mode and hardware fullscreen.

Fix a backroute in Come on Down to My Place, in lemforum.

Fix a backroute in Spin Me Around, in miniatures.

Re-order miniatures for difficulty: Uprank Diodes and The Bottomless Closet.

Added Shed of Presents, a multiplayer map for 2p and 6p.

music/minim-mobius/meadow-sunrise.ogg: Removed wrongly looped initial segment.
Before, the song started, then restarted after 2 seconds.

Work around a Linux-only bug in Allegro 5.2.8: Software fullscreen failed
to deduce the desktop resolution. Lix now passes the hardware fullscreen
resolution user option to Allegro even when entering a software fullscreen.
Without the bug, Allegro ingores the passed resolution and deduce the desktop
resolution, but with the bug, you can now achieve the right resolution.
The user option tooltip still claims that software fullscreen ignores the
resolution user options because this bug is Linux-only, it's already fixed,
and the bugfix will ship with the next stable Allegro 5 release.



0.10.5
------

2023-01-22

The replay tweaker shows little skill icons instead of the first three letters
of the assigned skill. This also allowed the tweaker to become narrower.

Whenever you assign one of the following skills with or without directional
force, the replay will always record a directionally forced assignment:
Walker, jumper, batter, builder, platformer, basher, miner. Holding
directional force for these skills is now merely a filter while you hover over
multiple lix. As before, unless you hold directional force, the replay will
record unforced assignments of: Permanent abilities, imploder, exploder,
blocker, digger.

Right-clicking now takes you back to the level browser from the
end-of-singleplayer screen or from the find-replay-for-level screen.

Redraw matt/underworld/Lava.W.png: The lava's top is now a wobbling surface,
not a straight line. Physics remain identical.

Lemforum prettiness: Tower of Babel: Corrected lighting on top blocks.
Added lower layer to central bridge to avoid bridge looking cut off.
Can't Reach It, Under the Rainbow, The Ring of Fnargl: Add/move stacked lava
because of the above change to matt/underworld/Lava.W.png.

Removed the spare platformer in One-Way Road to make it easier for Lovely.

Lemforum backroute fixes: Division of Labor: Add extra steel block in the
central wall, add little triangle at the top of the diagonal shaft.
Chasm: Add steel in the center. Theresa Falls Up the Stairs: Add second hatch.
Wait Why is There a Tree: Add a third notch to the top half of the pillar.
The Last Laugh: Surround the right-hand exit with steel to force solutions
that use the left-hand exit.



0.10.4
------

2023-01-09

Replay insert mode is a new user option. By default, this is off. When it's
off, assignments during replay cut the replay, then add the assignment, as
they have always done. If checked, assignments cut only the future of the same
lix: All assignments to that same lix, and nukes. The replay will keep
assignments to different lix. You must check this in the options and then it's
on permanently during play. You can't toggle it during play even though
that would be useful. Click air to cancel the global future as usual.

The replay tweaker will show nuke actions as "Nuke" in the line. Before, it
tried to interpret the line as an invalid skill line and showed "Not", the
first three letters of "Nothing".

Loading a savestate always restores the savestate's replay, unless its past is
equal to your replay's past and its future is a subset of your replay's
future. Before, loading a savestate didn't restore the savestate's replay if
its past was equal to your replay's past, regardless of future, and that made
it harder to treat the savestating functionality as a stash for one replay.

Radio-button options show a filled circle in the chosen box, not a checkmark.

When you haven't bound a hotkey to one of the functionalities of a two-task
button such as fast-forward, the button still showed a slash "/" at the start
or end of its hotkey reminder. Now, the slash only appears when both functions
have hotkeys.

Fixed backroutes in lemforum: Alien Invasion: Thinner starting platform. All
Aboard the Pain Train: Reduce steel in the central block. Down Among the Dead
Lix: Move one platform near the bottom, it still allows my backroute from
2022-12-22. The Circular Ruins: Lower block below the half-column. 6 Gaps, 5
Builders: Single builders can't cross two gaps anymore and you must stretch.
Down Among the Dead Lix: Fix a backroute by moving a lower platform right
and making it smaller for style. The Hotel in Hell: Expose the top-left
squisher. Add laser beam to prevent building over that squisher.

Improved lemforum levels: Recycling Plant: Removed a single leaf to reduce
precision when using the flinging gadget. Put Your Lix on Ice: Final miner
stops more easily by herself. Climb to Freedom: Added a climbable segment to
the rightmost climber-turning obstacle to show that climbing is a permanent
skill. This is a Stickup: Moved steel to reduce precision in initial crowd
control. Minimalism, 100% Built by Lixes: Removed some of the unused empty
space. Theresa Falls Up the Stairs: Corrected the lighting of the top-right
steel. Alien Abduction: Match graphical style of the fixed Alien Invasion.

Reordered lemforum levels: Upranked Ferry Tale and You'll Get Over It from
Lovely to Quirky. Downranked 6 Gaps, 5 Builders and Time to Change the Road
from Quirky to Lovely. Reordered several levels within Quirky.



0.10.3
------

2022-12-21

Fix #428: Update the next-level cache after solving. Before, there was the
following bug: Have three unsolved singleplayer levels -- A, B, and C -- in
this order. Enter A, exit to level browser, solve B, then solve A. Lix would
then offer B as unsolved, even though you've solved B. Now, the end-of-level
screen correctly offers B as solved and C as next unsolved level.

The end-of-singleplayer screen, when you choose to play the previous level
that you've just played, starts that previous level with your replay playing.
You can view your solution again or fix your attempt. (To avoid the replay,
interrupt it immediately when it starts playing, or instead start the previous
level from the singleplayer browser.)

Fix a backroute in mobius's Five for Fighting in lemforum/Vicious.

In lemforum/Lovely: Diamond Dash: Replace imploders and blockers with walkers.
The Borderland: Raise save requirement from 30/60 to 40/60 to require saving
lix from both hatches. Reorder Climb to Freedom earlier to avoid two
successive snow levels. Reorder Beneath the Lab to after Solar Eclipse.



0.10.2
------

2022-12-13

Fix #440: Replays load/save handicap. Old replays contain no handicap
information. Newly created replays will have handicap information and also
load and play it back correctly.

Fix #386: Allow to scroll to the very right edge even when the replay tweaker
is open. The bug was: Open the replay tweaker. You were not able to scroll all
the way to the right side of the map. You had to zoom out to see the entire
map, or zoom in deeply enough to make the tweaker obscure less of the level.
This was because the map only anticipated the normal panel on the screen, not
the tweaker. The map expected to be able to draw all the way to the right edge
of the screen. Now, even while the tweaker is open, you can scroll such that
the right end of the map is visible to the left of the tweaker.

Fix how the tweaker was appearing for a single frame on level start. This bug
has been in Lix for 4 years, but we never realized it because the old tweaker
didn't re-focus cameras when showing/hiding. Now, the tweaker starts hidden.

Backroute fixes to lemforum levels: Cornerstone, The Last Laugh,
Tinker Tailor Soldier Lix, Ferry Tale.

Clarify and beautify some more lemforum levels: Compression Method 2, Tapestry,
To Destroy Is to Construct, Narbacular Drop, The Road Goes Ever On (and both
of its repeats). Renamed mobius's Conundrum to Get Behind Me, Satan.

Add Everybody Wins, a multiplayer map by geoo for 4 through 8 players.

End-of-level screen says on its bottom button: Back to Level Browser.
Before, we had: Back to the Browser. That wasn't clear. Not everybody
considers the browser a browser.

Removed pre-2018 options/trophy format support. If you're updating from Lix
versions older than 5 years, you'll have to reconfigure your hotkeys.



0.10.1
------

2022-11-27

The replay browser shows the filename of the currently selected replay in the
nameplate below the preview, in addition to the existing fields (level name,
player, pointed-to level). If the replay filename is too long, e.g., because
you run Lix in a tall (= non-widescreen) resolution, the nameplate shows only
the hinder part. This way, you'll see both the frontal part of the filename
in the file picker on the left-hand side and the hinder part of the filename
in the nameplate on the right-hand side.

Added button to flip tiles vertically in the editor, in addition to the
existing button that mirrors horizontally. No hotkey is bound by default
to the vertical flip. You may assign a hotkey yourself.

Hotkey reminders in button corners appear in lighter text than before,
but still slightly darker than regular text.

In the options menu, moved some menu hotkey options further right on the
screen, to not overlap with the menu color pickers' description texts
on tall (= non-widescreen) resolutions.

In geoo's multiplayer map Ghetto Party, replaced imploders with exploders.
This is funnier and stays true to the original two-player Ghetto Wars.

Pruned empty space around Segmentation Fault in lemforum/Daunting.



0.10.0
------

2022-10-23

The server allows 0.9 and 0.10 in separate rooms. Decide with your friends
whether and when to update as a group to Lix 0.10.

Both 0.9 and 0.10 players can chat with each other in the server's lobby. The
0.10 client will see both 0.9 and 0.10 rooms, and print a console error when
you attempt to join a 0.9 room. Since 0.9 has no such functionality, the
server will not show 0.10 rooms to 0.9 players at all; instead, the server
will write a chat message to those 0.9 players in the lobby if any 0.10 rooms
exist, suggesting to update to 0.10.

Renamed the server executable from server to lixserv.

Added handicap for multiplayer games. If you're too strong for your group,
consider to click the handicap icon with the unbalanced scales in the game
room. You can choose fewer initial lix, fewer skills, a spawn delay, fewer
points per lix saved, or any combination of these four handicap types.

Fix #265: Allow simultaneous exiting. When you're playing a race map and reach
the exit at the same time as one or more different teams, all teams will score.
Before, only the red team would score.

Fix #311: Top and bottom of maps are hollow. Terrain checks beyond those edges
will not behave as if the edge row's terrain extended infinitely. Now, only the
left and right edges of the level extend terrain in this way, not all four
edges. Staircases built to the deadly ceiling will kill the builder as before,
but now all following walkers will also leave the level and die.

Adapted the singleplayer levels Cry for Me, Baywatch, and Walking in a Winter
Wonderland to work well with the hollow ceiling.

Allow ability assignments (climber, floater, runner) to blockers. For now,
these assignments have low priority; we can raise the priority after
playtesting as a UI change without changing physics.

Fix blocker dancing: Now, walkers (and other non-blockers) don't move when
they're both in a left-forcing blocker field and in a (different blocker's)
right-forcing blocker field. Before, walkers would move sideways through the
fields, turning each phyu. This looked like dancing.

Fix #266: Grant batters extra backwards range against blockers. We keep
forward batter range vs. blockers as in 0.9, even though it's a lot of forward
range so the batter sprite needn't overlap the blocker to still bat the
blocker. Nobody has complained so far, and it's nice to bat blockers without
awkward precision. We keep the batter range against other activities.

Half-fixed #397: The faller's distance in pixels fallen will not overflow
the 32-bit int anymore. I didn't fix the overflow for physics updates yet, you
can still play longer than what fits into the 32-bit int that counts physics
updates (4.5 years at normal speed, or 46 days at turbo-fast-forward).

Moved the frogs' trigger areas downward by 1 pixel, so that the coordinates
are divisble by 2. No levels broke from this, not even Las Ranas Hermanas.

Fix #410: Removed spike at top of both matt/beach/04 tiles (day and night).
Before, both tiles had identical masks; now, both tiles still have identical
masks, although the mask is different than before. There is no odd prong
at the top right of those tiles anymore.

Fix #414: Fixed transparency/air pixels in earth.png from the Oriental set.
The top row of pixels was not fully transparent (that would be 0 % alpha);
it had an estimated 5 % alpha. Lix treats that as solid. Walkers were walking
over solid, nearly invisible pixels. Now, earth.png has full transparency
above the earth. No levels broke from this change.

Fixed #322: Don't wrap during tile group construction: Now, when you load a
tile group on a small torus map, Lix will construct the group without wrongly
wrapping the group's elements before grouping. Only when Lix has fully
constructed the group tile, Lix will insert the group into the torus level.



0.9.48
------

2022-10-15

Don't cap level search results at 18, but show all results. Downside: Now, I
expect the search to be slow when you enter the first one-two letters. We'll
see what is worse and can still improve the search in the future.

Always return to lobby after playing multiplayer with a single tribe, even
when that tribe hasn't fulfilled the hidden save requirement from
singleplayer. Lix has never properly supported 1-tribe multiplayer, but Lix
has never explicitly disallowed it either.

The connection picker in the networking menu will now connect when you press
the generic Okay hotkey, in addition to the networking menu hotkey.

Fixed option dialog's help text for the username option: All translations
explained ./data/user/yourname.txt, which is out of use since 2017. Now,
all translations explain ./user/options.sdl, the correct save file.

Added FreeDesktop resources in ./data/desktop/ by Matthias MailÃ¤nder. Thanks!
I don't know yet where to put such resources (that aren't needed directly by
Lix while Lix is running) in the future; ./data/ is catch-all for now.


0.9.47
------

2022-08-11

Add Swedish translation of the Lix user interface by Sanchez. Thanks!

Fix #387: Update skill panel on tweak. Now, after shifting a skill assignment
forward or backward by a single frame in the replay tweaker, the skill panel
updates all skill buttons' counts accordingly. This matters when some skills
assignments have become illegal in the now-edited replay.



0.9.46
------

2022-06-25

Added geoo's new multiplayer maps, including the two asymmetric maps
Uphill Battle and Ivory Tower. Updated some of geoo's maps:
Fixed the drop straight into exit pit in Rescue Ranger Trolls.
Added block to default version of Ghetto Party. Minor other changes.

Added Kingshadow's new multiplayer levels. Updated Kingshadow's levels, e.g.,
added a missing trap to Straight & Curved 4p.

Prevent infinite fallers at the sides of Flopsy's Rescue Plan 5p by
narrowing the map horizontally to the existing terrain.

Renamed my old 2p map Rescue Rangers to Fry-Day to avoid a name collision with
the popular maps Rescue Ranger Trolls and Rescue Rangers Double Team.

Fix #434: Always topology-wrap newly inserted pieces in the editor to avoid
running into some strict assertions in a debug build. There should have been
no bug here in release builds. Improved some assertion texts.



0.9.45
------

2022-05-21

Added many multiplayer levels by Flopsy, including Krypton Factor race.

Added multiplayer levels by Kingshadow: Straight & Curved,
Marble Puzzle League, Spiral Spyfall, The Ascending Lix Scenario,
Tricky Breakthrough.

Added tags ($TAG lines in levels) to several maps by Flopsy.

Fix lagging client in a 10-hour netgame. This was an esoteric bug that never
surfaced in normal usage. When the same networking game (not netplay session
or server run, but really individual game; what happens after you click
"ready" in the lobby) ran for over 10 hours, the client would stop
updating at the normal speed of 15 physics updates per second, and instead run
at 10 frames per second.

Make Lix compile with the newly released DMD 2.100.0.

Mention FreeGameDev IRC channel #lix in the main readme. QuakeNet #lix
is still the development channel. I still recommend QuakeNet #lix to find
players, with FreeGameDev #lix as an alternative.



0.9.44
------

2022-03-03

Fix a memory-corrupting bug when sending chat messages.
I introduced this bug in 0.9.43.

Fix #432: Don't resave watched multiplayer replays. The bug was: After the
replay, we entered the end-of-singleplayer dialog, and this dialog always
re-saved the watched replay as a new multiplayer replay. Now, we directly
return to the replay browser. The end-of-singleplayer dialog doesn't appear
and doesn't save a duplicate.



0.9.43
------

2022-03-29

Fix server-side permutation bug: In 0.9.42, the server re-rolled the
permutation of starting points for every player. This desynched the maps --
unless you were only playing 2-player on perfectly symmetrical maps and never
used directional force.

Don't send up to 300 nullbytes on short chat packets, send only the necessary
bytes. Keep max chat length at 300 UTF-8 code units.

In the lobby, sort the list of players. First criterion: Players sort higher
than observers. Second criterion: Red sorts higher than orange, yellow, ...
Third criterion: Within each color, sort by player name. Ready/unready doesn't
affect sorting. It's easier now to see which/how many colors are in use, but
I'll leave open github issue #407: Color buttons in lobby, show current usage.

Disable the expensive level-drawing unittest that also didn't clean up
its file in ./export/.

macOS: Rely on pkg-config according to Allegro's documentation here:
https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/blob/master/README_pkgconfig.txt
Before, on macOS ARM64, ld didn't find the Allegro libs even with pkg-confic
installed; see github issue #430.

Remove obsolete build documentation ./doc/build/allegro5.txt and
cross-reference more clearly between other files in ./doc/build/.



0.9.42
------

2022-02-25

Don't focus the IP address entry field in the lobby when you select "connect
to somebody else". The focusing led to a bug that is now fixed: The field
would even be unhidden and focused whenever the lobby window reappeared after
a game, when you were already connected and in a room.

Alleviated enet versioning mismatch: derelict-enet offers D bindings only for
enet 1.3.15, but the binaries of enet 1.3.16 or the current enet 1.3.17 have
differently-sized struct ENetPeer. Now, the Lix server computes the struct
size at runtime, allowing to run with all enet binaries >= 1.3.13.

Fixed a theoretically possible, although unlikely, memory leak in networking.

Fixed a linker warning about max!(int, int). Now, Lix's code itself generates
zero warnings again.

Refactored the server-side networking code. Rooms carry their own logic. This
will help in the future to support version restrictions per room.

Fixed DMD 64-bit build on all operating systems by avoiding obscure usercode
that crashes DMD.

Linux build notes: Added workaround for LDC running out of stack space. You
can raise the stack size in the current shell with: ulimit -s 16384

Windows 32-bit build notes: Added DLL download for LDC-compatible 32-bit
libraries.

Removed note from April 2020 in the readme about compilers before LDC 1.21;
compilers that old aren't prevalent anymore.



0.9.41
------

2022-01-06

Support tags in level files to help organize the multiplayer levels. Levels
can contain zero or more tags, one per line. Edit tags with a text editor; we
can work towards better editing support in Lix itself in the future. Example:
$TAG mytag

The editor loads and saves tags, but doesn't yet display them anywhere and
doesn't offer to edit them. The level browsers don't print tags anywhere
either yet.

The level search (in the singleplayer or multiplayer browser) will find
tags, but you have to enter the exact tag completely. Half-words that
appear inside tags do not find that tag. (I'm not yet sure if this behavior
is best; we can change it.)



0.9.40
------

2021-12-13

Added configurable hotkeys to play next levels from the end-of-singleplayer
screen. Default is F1 to replay the same level, Space to play the next level,
F to play the next unsolved level. There is no default hotkey to save the
replay manually; you can configure it.

Hotkey reminders on buttons are printed in slightly darker text. They're
still brighter than the button itself, but darker than the main button text.

Fix #417: The editor shows all teams per gadget. Example: 4 players A, B, C, D
and the map has 2 exits. Before 0.9.40, the editor printed on the exits: A, B.
Now, the editor print on the exits the outcome of distributing the 4 players
round-robin to the exits: AC, BD.

Clarify tile group names in the documentation doc/formats/level.txt: Groups
can have any name, not necessarily only a number. Since I don't have support
in the program for copying tile groups between levels, you can at least rename
the groups in one level, e.g, by search-and-replace, then copy-paste them into
the second level, and have no name clashes.

Fixed exits order in Tunnel of Love 6p. There were 7 exits in a 6-player map,
leading to apparent removal of a necessary exit in play. Now it has 6 exits.

Added new multiplayer maps by Flopsy: The Lix and the Saboteurs 4p, 6p, 8p.

Clarify documentation on tile groups in doc/format/level.txt: Tile groups
can have any names. When you copy tile groups by hand between levels, you
can first rename them with text replacement.

Allow warnings when building Lix. This circumvents a warning in Phobos that
would otherwise abort the build: Duplicate symbol for max!(int, int).max,
_D3std9algorithm10comparison__T3maxTiTiZQjFNaNbNiNfiiZi.



0.9.39
------

2021-10-12

Added a dedicated end-of-singleplayer screen to show stats of the finished
attempt, to offer the immediate next level, and to offer the next unsolved
level in case the player has already solved the immediate next level.

Darkened the labels "by" and "Goal:" in front of level nameplates in
the browser and in the end-of-level screen. They're now darker than the
normal text color. Title, author and goal stand out better in their normal
text color now.

Re-added 3 levels -- Fill the Floor, Interval Training, Chaos Theory --
to single/clam/Outtakes. Fill the Floor and Interval Training originally
needed variable spawn intervals during play; now, they employ floaters and
runners at fixed spawn intervals. Chaos Theory originally needed the nuke
to solve; now, it employs manually assigned exploders to fling.

Updated the Lix source code to comply with the future meaning of the "in"
keyword. Updated Lix for package optional 1.3.0 instead of 0.6.3.



0.9.38
------

2021-06-27

Windowed mode at 1280x720 is now the default on running Lix for the very first
time. Before, the default was software fullscreen a.k.a. fullscreen window.

Smaller widescreen resolutions such at 1280x720 that would barely fail to pick
2x for the skill panel icons (instead of the tiny 1x) will get slightly higher
panel to accomodate the better-looking 2x skill icons.

Adjusted text vertical offset to vertically center text on buttons better at
1280x720. 1280x800 is still okay, text is now slightly too high here. The text
positioning is already full of hacks and compromises, anything better either
needs more hacks or a clean do-over. I feel like a 90's website designer.

The main menu preserves the background's aspect ratio. To fill a screen that
is not 4:3, it crops the background's sides.

Revenge of the Giant Crab (2p): Added decoration, walkers 10->30, overtime
30->90 seconds.

Fix #424: Always show the level title in the lobby under the graphical preview,
even when we return from a netgame.

Fix #423: De-duplicate the multiplayer level tree, as reported by Dullstar.
I had extra copies of Along the Fabrics of Your Clothing in the 8p directory.

Updated Allegro DLLs to Allegro 5.2.7.1. You can check what Lix uses at
runtime with Lix's command-line argument: --allgero-version

I build the 32-bit Windows release with LDC, not with DMD. LDC generates
faster-running machine code, exactly what we want for a release version. Tell
me in case you run into any problems. (64-bit Windows release has always been
built with LDC and it still is.)

During compilation, Lix prints target architecture, OS, and compiler.

Fix deprecations for DMD 2.097.0: In the source code, the "body" keyword is
finally deprecated. Converted the entire codebase to the "do" keyword in front
of function bodies. Added "static import std.stdio;" to access std.stdio.File
in Lix's file.filename.base.

Documentation: src/icon/readme.txt has CRLF line endings, to be readable in
Windows Notepad. (Documentation should have CRLF endings, code should have LF
endings.) Removed note in the 32-bit DMD Windows build notes about NuGet libs,
DMD 32-bit doesn't play well with them.

The build documentation points to new archives (lix-dlls-libs-dmd32.zip,
lix-dlls-libs-ldc32.zip, lix-dlls-libs-win64.zip) because the .lib files
can be incompatible between compilers.



0.9.37

2021-05-17

Added new maps from the multiplayer level contest. Thanks,
Dominator_101, Dullstar, Flopsy, geoo, IchoTolot, WillLem!
Includes Dominator_101's Rescue Rangers Double Team.

Fixed flickering mouse cursor in the dialog that aborts a networking game.
Before, when you hovered over a lix in the background of the dialog, the
cursor would osciallte between open and closed. Now, the cursor stays closed
because you can't assign to lix during the dialog.

Partly address #234: When you resize the map in the editor, the editor will
zoom out as far as it can to show you the entire map. It's still disorienting
to resize maps with large empty areas.

Fix: When you verified a directory containing 0 replays in the GUI verifier,
the GUI verifier didn't print the line that you can now click to exit. Now
it prints that line.

In the main menu, below the version number, print name of operating system and
32/64-bit for which the running version is built.

The debugging build's user options defaults show the phyus/FPS. This only
matters when you run a debugging build without a user option file
user/options.sdl. The normal release build defaults to not showing phyus/FPS
until you enable it in the options menu.

In dub.json, removed obsolete architecture restriction for Windows builds
with LDC.

The Windows 64-bit build notes point to LDC's multilib release instead of to
the pure 64-bit release. You can use LDC's installer or LDC's 7z download. The
main difference is that LDC's lib/ dir is now called lib64/. Updated
https://www.lixgame.com/dow/lix-dlls-libs-win64.zip with the new directory name
lib64/ instead of lib/.

Documented the level format in doc/formats/level.txt. Documented in the
Windows build notes doc/build/win*.txt where to get Allegro binaries from
NuGet.



0.9.36
------

2021-02-24

Add a whopping 66 multiplayer maps by Flopsy, including Perfect Situation.

Fix #413: The new-level button in the editor will now ask for data loss
before clearing the map and clearing the undo buffer. You can click Save,
Discard, or Cancel.

Reword the grid tooltip in the editor to clarify that it will affect future
moves; it will have no immediate effect on the current selection.
Before: "Grid 2: Rounds tiles' coordinates to multiples of 2."
Now: "Grid 2: Tiles will move in steps of 2 pixels."
Thanks to WillLem for feedback and wording.

Support a hidden option (not in the options menu) that allows you to suppress
the editor's offset of copypasted tiles; this is (16,16) by default.
(Hidden options are hacks; for the long term, I need to visualize the copying
in place.) For now, to suppress the offset, put in your user/options.sdl:
editorCopiedTilesOffset 0

Mouse speed on Linux defaults to 10, not 20. This produces better results
on my machine when (fast movement frees mouse) is off, the default on Linux.
I haven't examined the speed on other systems yet.

Update the build docs in doc/build/ about minimum compiler versions.

In the doc/formats/ directory, document replay pointing, terrain lines in
levels, groups in levels.



0.9.35
------

2020-12-24

Undo/redo feature: The editor allows full undo and redo. Everything that is
visible in the editor's level display is undoable: Tile moves, z-reorderings,
additions, deletions, copying, rotations, mirroring, darkening, and changing
the level's height, width, wrappings, and background color. Pressing the
button to create a new level clears the undo history. Changing the level's
name, lix, save requirement, player count, or skillset isn't undoable, but
doesn't clear the undo history either; you can still undo earlier things.
This undo/redo feature has been in development for 7 months.

Fix #406: The camera rounds correctly to determine the mouse coordinates
in the level. Before, with deep zoom, the mouse seemed to select things
1 pixel too far right and 1 pixel too far down.

Fix #405: The editor reinitializes its camera when the level's torus wrapping
changes. This prevents graphical leftovers.

Fixed compilation errors that appeared with DMD 2.094.2.

Added build notes for a 64-bit Windows build with DMD. I encourage to use LDC
instead of DMD for release builds, but it's good to have more options.



0.9.34

2020-10-11

lemforum: Backroute fixes for 6 levels, mainly due to Wibble's backroutes:
Bipolar Maniac, initial lix 10->11, floaters 5->6.
Las Ranas Hermanas, raise frogs.
Triangle Inequality, eliminiate trivializing backroute.
One Lix Showdown, likely functional but slightly unelegant fix.
Some Like to Run, faster spawn interval, needs checking.
Skulls, Sludge and Steel - possible fix, needs checking.
(No fixes yet for Duality and Dream the impossible Dream.)

Fix #404: The 64-bit Windows enet.dll crashed on hosting a networking game.
Now, I ship a new 64-bit enet.dll, version 1.3.12, that fixes the crash
on Windows, even though it still crashes in Wine.

Support 32-bit Windows again: I publish 32-bit Windows binaries in the github
releases and added linker flags for the 32-bit Windows DMD build in dub.json.

Updated D source libraries in dub.json: derelict-enet 4.1.0 -> 4.2.0,
taggedalgebraic 0.11.12 -> 0.11.18. This should have no visible effects.

Credit minim in doc/thanks.txt for upscaling the GUI icons to 150%, 200%, 300%
of the C++ Lix icons for 640x480 = 100%. minim worked on these icons in 2016.

Remove doc/oldwish.txt, it has become outdated. The text is preserved at:
https://www.lemmingsforums.net/index.php?topic=5132.0
Let's file issues on github instead.



0.9.33

2020-08-09

Fix #402: With more than 18 assignments, the tweaker doesn't mispaint the
line for current physics update over the tape recorder buttons anymore.

Fix #401: The tweaker erases the lines properly when two assignments change
order from tweaking. This fixes a mispainting of assignment lines.

Fix #385: Before, with 18 or more assignments, the completely filled tweaker
always hid the assignments that came last in the replay. Now, the tweaker
hides assignments that are far away from the current physics update. Now, to
view early assignments, rewind the game. To see late assignments, forward the
game.



0.9.32
------

2020-08-01

Distribution: Lix has an openSUSE package for easy installation on openSUSE
Linux, thanks to Martin H.! This is our third Linux packaging after Debian and
Arch. Updated Lix's readme and documentation.

Added Raymanni's crab trap at images/raymanni/crab.T.txt. There is an example
level, Crab Nightmare, in levels/misc/simon/crabnightmare.txt.

Added Thirteen Little Skills (version 2), a level contest entry by Proxima.

Every Lix for Herself (lemforum Lovely): Quicken the spawn interval, to
make it nicer to assign floaters to lix from the leftmost hatch.

Multiplayer: Pressing twice the end-game key (Esc by default) doesn't
exit the match, but rather opens and cancels the exit-match dialog.
This avoids accidental exiting. To exit the match via keyboard,
press Esc, then the key to delete files/lose data.

Replay tweaker: Add an extra line for the currently-shown physics update.

Remove the unnecessary translatable string optionShowButtonHotkeys. Button
hotkeys are always shown, there is no option to disable that; this option was
removed in Lix 0.9.30. This removes the leftover language field, so that
data/language/*.txt doesn't warn on loading a language.

Code: Fix deprecations according to DMD 2.093: Annotate ref-returning
functions with return



0.9.31
------

2020-04-23

Compiling yourself: On Windows, Lix requires LDC 1.21.0, LDC or newer to
compile out of the box. For LDC 1.20.1 or older, in Lix's dub.json file, you
must first change all appearances of "-entry:wmainCRTStartup"
with "-entry:mainCRTStartup".
See doc/build/win64.txt, section "Old LDC versions" for details.

Compiling yourself: Increased version of dependency sdlang-d: 0.10.4 -> 0.10.6,
so that Lix still compiles with older versions of DMD, with the current stable
DMD 2.091.0, and with even newer versions.

Fix #394: The editor now sorts tilesets alphabetically by the shown directory,
which is its second-level-nested directory in images/.
Old order: forest/, occult/, abstract/, construction/, ..., because forest and
occult were in images/amanda/ and abstract, construction were in images/geoo/.
New order: abstract/, beach/, bricks/, carnival/, construction/, ..., forest/,
..., occult/, ..., irrespective of the unshown author's name.

Fixed a backroute in Ifo Island. The building at the bottom takes longer now.



0.9.30
------

2019-12-28

Fix #339: Imploder animation: Now, purple stars and vortexes circle around the
center, then get sucked into the center. The old animation was too slow
and subtle.

Fix #388: Oblivion sound was too noisy and high-pitched. Replaced this
sound effect with meow-like voice acting that is not shrill.

lemforum: ccexplore fixed a backroute in Brickout.

Always print hotkeys on buttons' lower-right corner. Removed user option that
toggled whether hotkeys would be printed on buttons.

Code: Remove body encounters from physics implementation; these happened at
(foot - 4), (foot - 8), (foot - 12). Always check foot encounters instead.
Before, only fire hazards checked for body encounters. Draw larger trigger
area (in the editor) for fire to compensate. No changes to file formats. No
changes to physics.

Multiplayer maps: Added Down with Frogs by Flopsy.
Added remake of Humps (2-player map from 2010) using Lix's earth terrain.
Removed endless falls at the side of Honeypots.



0.9.29
------

2019-07-18

Observers in a networking game begin zoomed out; they see the entire map
without any extra input.

In multiplayer, there are no more black boxes on the score graph after a nuke.
The black boxes obscured the bars of low-scoring players. The black boxes were
a hack solution before we had the nice score board when you mouse over the
score graph. Now, to see who nuked, mouse over the score graph.

Partially fix #385: The replay tweaker displays only the first 18 plies
(= assignments or nukes) instead of painting the 19th, 20th, ... ply over the
remainder of the panel. In the long run, the tweaker needs a scrollbar.

The tweaker explains itself with short text while it has no plies to show yet.
This is better than presenting the tweaker as a completely blank GUI widget.

Fix #327: After you save a replay manually from the replay browser, the browser
reloads the directory and immediately shows the newly saved file.

Fix: The splat ruler draws properly again when the mouse is on the map (i.e.,
off the panel). 0.9.28 had a bug where the ruler would only draw while the
mouse was on the panel instead of on the land.

Fix: In multiplayer battles, you can zoom again, even though there is no
GUI button to zoom. By default, zoom is bound to the mouse wheel.

Fix #317: In a deeply nested directory hierarchy, the browsers' breadcrumb
navigation condenses some higher-level directories into a single button.
The top-level directory keeps its exclusive button at the very left.

Removed a default keybinding duplication: Highlight goals and splat ruler were
both bound to Tab. Now, only the splat ruler is bound to Tab, highlight goals
has no default hotkey.



0.9.28
------

2019-07-07

Replay tweaker: A new feature for singleplayer puzzle solving. To open the
replay tweaker, click the filmstrip button in the panel. The tweaker allows
you to move and delete assignments deep in the replay without erasing
any other assignments. The tweaker is not perfect yet: I'm sure we'll find
many ways to improve it.

Added 22 singleplayer levels from various level design contests. They are in
levels/single/misc/contests/. All levels are proven solvable. Some proofs may
be backroutes. For Key to the Sacred Kingdom, I chose its version 9, the
miniature, but extended it with decoration from its big version 7. Adapted
Long Division to 0.9 physics, it's fairer now and less nasty.

Fix #364: If the enet DLL is missing, the networking lobby prints an error
message to its console. Before, the game would crash from an uncaught
exception.

Code: Fix deprecations for dmd 2.087.0: Don't initialize immutable variables
in thread-local static this(), instead initialize them in shared static this().
Lix should now compile warning-free.



0.9.27
------

2019-05-20

Fixed a backroute in The Bottomless Closet, a miniature by geoo.

Fix #379: The editor avoids cloning tiles outside of the map. Usually, the
editor moves freshly-cloned tiles down-right by (16, 16). Sometimes, this
would move tiles out of the map. New behavior: If a cloned tile would move out
of the map, or even very close to the edge (= undercutting a safety margin of
16 pixels), all cloned tiles are moved up-left by (16, 16) instead. If neither
offset keeps all tiles on the map, we move down-right by (16, 16) and accept
that some are outside. In torus directions, tiles are always on the map within
the safety margin.

Fix #380: While you change the background color in the editor's map dialog,
the level behind the dialog previews your chosen color in real time. When
you press OK, the color stays; when you press Cancel, the color reverts.

Code: Fixed deprecations, now Lix compiles warning-free on dmd 2.086.0.

Code: Removed module constructors and moved construction of user options
into al_run_main. We hope to troubleshoot a segfault on macOS with this,
github issue #381. Renamed DisplayTryMode to ScreenChoice.



0.9.26
------

2019-04-24

Added 24 singleplayer levels in misc/lemforum-outtakes. These levels were
once part of out flagship pack lemforum, but have been taken out over time.
They're all proven solvable with 0.9 physics.

Fixed #301: Separated the ping-exit functionality from show-splat-ruler.
In multiplayer, there are now two buttons. Both have much clearer icons
(an exit with beams, a ruler) instead of the generic cool shades.

Fixed #293: Savestate icon, don't use floppy disk (means: write file).
Now, the icon to save state is a flag, and the icon to load state is
a flag with an arrow pointing towards it. Once a savestate exists,
the load icon (default hotkey F2) is to the left of the save icon
(default hotkey F3), to have their default hotkeys (F2, F3) in ascending
order. (Before, load appeared to the right of save).

Renamed the level folder "Community Collab Project" to "Collab"
for concise breadcrumb navigation captions, preventing abbreviation.

Attributed correct authors (Rubix/Simon, Simon/Wuzzy) on two tutorials.

Rewrote screen options functions, to rule out a possible source of a crash
on macOS (no more try-return-catch, always return outside of try/catch).
See issue #381: macOS 10.14: Black screen then crash.

Rewrote internal graphics code to get already-cached images more efficiently.



0.9.25
------

2019-02-04

Added 44 singleplayer levels in levels/single/misc: 17 miniatures by Simon and
geoo, 13 levels by mobius (originally called leftovers and non-tutorials), 10
levels by Nessy, 4 non-miniatures by Simon. These levels were released around
2017 and 2018 on Lemmings Forums and are now part of the main download.

Added 15 tutorials for basic skill usage. A new Lix installation will still
highlight Any Way You Want as first level, not the tutorials.

Eased the 2-player multiplayer map Anything Can Work: Removed buzzsaws, added
terrain to allow a downwards route without preparatory platforming above exits.

Fixed deprecations (silent conversion from size_t to int in loop indices)
to allow a warning-free building with the current compiler DMD 2.084.

Refactored code for clarity: Alcol constructors -> al_map_rgba_f, magic
numbers in EffectManager -> enums. Split ScoreBoard into two classes and
moved to the GUI code, to decouple from gameplay.



0.9.24
------

2019-01-03

Work around bug #372 (garbled exit markers): Removed alpha channel from
data/images/goalmark.I.png. Arrow's white overlay is entirely opaque. Made
overlay line thinner to compensate for the fully-opaque overlay. This should
avoid #372 to trigger at all. Everything should recolor properly.

Multiplayer directories: Sort authors with easier multiplayer maps.
Easy means that it's easy to save lix against opponents that do nothing.
Reason: New players click on the first-listed authors very often.
This is not an ideal permanent solution, but we have needed something like
this quickly for the Debian 10 release.

New multiplayer maps by Flopsy: Cascade Squared (4p, 6p, 8p) and
The Storeroom (6p, 8p).

Fix bug with _order.X.txt files: When you go to a dir A with order file, then
go to a different dir B without order file but with files named like those in
A, the files in B are now sorted alphabetically, not wrongly by the order
file from A.

The options file ./user/options.sdl contains a comment explaining that
screenMode 0 is windowed, 1 is software fullscreen, 2 is hardware fullscreen.



0.9.23

2018-12-09

xmas2018: Fixed backroutes in Home Time for Santa, Snow Cat Love,
Decorate the Tree, Past the Xmas Tree.

ClamLix: Time is Running Out, decorated the steel with a steel hourglass.

Fix #371: Miners throw a pickaxe again when they cancel on steel. Diggers
won't throw pickaxes anymore by mistake when they cancel on steel.

Added a manpage for Linux package maintainers: doc/lix.6, thanks to tarzeau.



0.9.22
------

2018-11-30

Include xmas2018: a new singleplayer pack with 24 holiday-themed levels.

Fix #350: In singleplayer, the splat ruler button tooltip claimed falsely
that this button also pings hatches and exits, but it does that only in
multiplayer. Fixed this tooltip. (Issue #301 remains: In multiplayer, this
button should be functionally split into two buttons.)

Support 64-bit Windows builds with LDC >= 1.13.0-beta2. I encourage all
Windows users to choose the 64-bit build over the 32-bit build, hoping to
avoid the out-of-RAM crashes on large maps.

Binary downloads are now hosted on github, not on Lix's homepage.

Binary download archives carry a version number in their filename and unpacked
Lix directory. With self-contained Lix (i.e., not installed system-wide via a
Linux package manager), you should still update existing self-contained Lix as
usual by copying your user files, custom levels, and replays from the old
directory into the new.

Fix #369: When you build from source and choose a debugging version instead
of a release version, Lix will start windowed by default, not with software
fullscreen. User options can override this as usual.

Updated the DAllegro5 bindings to 4.0.4+5.2.0 and removed Lix's allegro-color
dependency on all platforms.

Many refactorings in the source code for physics updates. No physics changes.
This will be useful in case I manage efficient skill blueprints a.k.a. skill
shadows.



0.9.21
------

2018-10-19

Fix #313: Options and trophies (level checkmarks) are now saved in ./user/,
not in ./data/user/yourname.txt. In the future, whenever you update Lix by
hand, copy the folder user/ into the new installation. Old settings and
trophies are imported: To update to 0.9.21, you should still copy
./data/config.txt and ./data/user/yourname.txt to let Lix 0.9.21 import your
old settings and write them to ./user/.)

Fix #255: Trophies (level checkmarks) are associated to levels by the levels'
basename (the part of the filename that is independent from directories),
author, and English title. Trophies are not associated to full level path
anymore, even though they remember that path as extra information. This means
that you keep your trophy even when its level moves to a different rank
directory.

lemforum: Feel the Pressure: Hopeless -> Daunting. This Is a Stickup: Daunting
-> Vicious. Evacuate the Sinking Ship: Vicious -> Hopeless. Little Miner
Puzzle 1: Adjusted height of one bar to avoid accidental splatting while a
miner is working. The Borderland: Added buzzsaw that This Lix Is Your Lix
(repeat) already had.

Raymanni's Holiday exit: Enlarged sprite at the bottom to look better when
the exit sits on bumpy terrain.

Fix #359: When you have lost singleplayer and the game tells you to framestep
back or abort, you can doubleclick the nuke to quit.

Fix #323: Wide, flat torus maps start with less default zoom (you see a larger
portion of the level).

Editor: All steel is offered in a single flat list. I've sorted the more
commonly used tiles to the top of this list.

Editor: Removed an invisible extra button that 0.9.20 mistakenly generated
and that sometimes became visible when you hovered over the 3 rightmost text
buttons in the panel and held the mouse key down.

Fix #363: Editor: The terrain browser does not offer the 3 directories
./authorName/steel/, to de-clutter the tileset list.

Fix #355: Multiplayer: Exit markers are solid, colorful arrows instead of
large lixes. They still go behind the terrain. The outline of your own arrow
is drawn semi-transparent over the terrain.

The networking menu offers to host a game (a server will run within Lix) and
offers to change the port for listening or connecting.

Fix #358: In a networking room, the current level title is printed under the
preview image, above the chat.

License: During the CC0 public domain waiver, I mention explicitly that the
levels are CC0.

Server executable understands the switch --port <number> to listen on a
different port.

Server is now its own dub package in ./src/server/ in the Lix repository.
Documented how to build and run standalone server executable in Lix's main
README.md.

Code: I refactored Hatch to contain Graphic instead of to inherit from
Graphic. Hatches remember which players spawn from them. Physics remain
identical. (I tested a lot manually, no automatic test; I still lack physics
unittests in general.)

Git users: I version-control dub.selections.json now. If you get merge issues,
delete your local copy and then pull.



0.9.20
------

2018-09-23

Backroute fixes in Continuum Hypothesis and Inside the Fourth Wall.
Fewer lixes in Undercutting the Competition.

Reshaded rectangular blocks in matt/marble: Shading at the left and top should
only become lighter towards the outside. Before, the blocks looked flattened.
Diagonal blocks in matt/marble still have this issue.

Fix #349: Mirror button icon shows horizontal mirroring with two triangles,
not vertical mirroring with an upside-down tree anymore.

Partially fix #348: Custom grid button shows size of current custom grid.

Center images on BitmapButtons more accurately.

Removed unused UI graphics: Spawn interval graphic, hint selection graphic,
editor hatch direction graphic that is shown with a unicode arrow instead.

Fix #356: When you specify -w or --resol=XXXxYYY on the command line,
loading/switching the user configuration will not override the command line's
resolution in this session.

Reorganized the trophy area of the singleplayer browser: Don't draw last
game's results over the personal best of lix saved.

dub package Optional: I use Optional 0.6.3 now instead of Optional 0.4.x. This
requires a recent compiler (I know that 2.082 or newer works) when you build
Lix yourself.



0.9.19
------

2018-08-10

RepForLev: For a highlighted level in the singleplayer browser, you can enter
the new dialog RepForLev that will offer all replays that start with the
basename of the highlit level. (If the level file is "mylevel.txt", RepForLev
will offer all replays that start with "mylevel-".)

lemforum, some backroute fixes: Get Hype, remove flinging backroute. Toccata,
use Proxima's backroute fix against a solution that takes 30 minutes. Striking
News, add water pit at the top, different cactus placement at the bottom.
Behind Bars, save 8/10.

Multiplayer maps: Flopsy's shorter Block Chaos, Harden the Paint. Raymanni's
Rainbow Road, The Frog-Hotel, Follow the Thread.

Fix #354: Prevent the one-pixel-thick line of graphical garbage at the right
edge of the map. This line occurred with some noninteger zooms during
play/editor.

Fix #344: Guideline pieces are selectable from the terrain browser again.
Depth-2-directories (e.g., "geoo/construction/") are listed as only the second
directory ("construction/") in the root selection of tile browser.



0.9.18
------

2018-07-01

lemforum: Behind Bars 7/10->8/12 to remove backroute. One Step Off
80/80->20/20. Segmentation Fault 20/40->21/40. Merge Sort, hollow terrain
to remove red herrings. Rhapsody in Blue, aligned traps to terrain
(removes 1-pixel gaps). Removed obviously unassignable
imploders/exploders/cubers according to save requirement.

Rubix's levels: Lost Underground, cap reachable ceiling more clearly.
Removed obviously unassignable imploders/exploders/cubers.

Tiles: Raymanni's improved carnival exit, cleaner large proxima/tiles/orange2.

Fix #23: Don't show obsolete replay arrows/pickaxes/sounds when you
framestep after a quickload.

Fix #346: When you watch a replay, interrupt, and win, the solution
replay is auto-saved.

Singleplayer exits the level after nuking instead of prompting to
framestep back.

On display creation, the mouse cursor centers on the Lix window. This prevents
edge scrolling when watching replays from the command line.

Fix #340: For translations, use format strings (containing %s, %d with runtime
checks) instead of several concatenated translated strings.

Fix #341: Translate the output of the replay verifier.

Fix #342: Better grammar, fewer Denglish (English words in the German
translation even though good German words exist), add umlauts. Thanks to
Wuzzy for this patch!

In displayed strings, use typographical quotation marks. In file/shell output,
use double quotes both to begin and end instead of asymmetric quotes.



0.9.17
------

2018-05-27

lemforum/Hopeless: Swapped Bipolar Maniac (now 3rd) and Systematic Separation
(now 10th) in Hopeless.

Score board in multiplayer: Hover over the score graph to see player names,
exact lix counts, and exact number of scored points, in a large tooltip.

Fix #319: The terrain/steel browsers offer all dirs of depth 2 in images/ at
once. After navigating to such a depth-2-dir, the terrain/steel browsers offer
in one flat list all tiles recursively found in that dir.

Don't save other people's winning replays as your own checkmarks. Correctly
save checkmarks after playing levels passed to Lix on the command line.

On loading a replay with zero players, don't crash anymore, instead create one
player with the singleplayer color.

The Windows download contains Allegro 5.2.4 DLLs. These newer DLLs fix any
remaining chance that Lix starts without sound when starting Lix from the
Windows 8/10 quicklaunch bar.

Lix has a new command-line switch --allegro-version to print the version
number of the dynamically-loaded Allegro DLLs.

Build system: Lix builds with both the most recent DMD 2.080 and with the
better-optimizing LDC. I added allegro_color to the link libs. I require D
Allegro 5 bindings of version >= 4.0.2 to fix a stack overflow in Debian
LDC-built Lix.

0.9.16
------

2018-05-01

lemforum: Removed backroutes in We're in This One Together (added steel)
and From the Other Side (larger fire pit).

Fix #328: Automatic replays are saved after multiplayer games again.

Fix: Watching a multiplayer replay will never save another replay.

I credit our contributors in doc/thanks.txt. Let me know if anything there
is inaccurate.

0.9.15
------

2018-04-20

Behind You, Down Among the Dead Lix: Removed backroutes. Added Twelve-Bar
Blues, a new multiplayer map by Proxima.

Fix #326: In the editor, clicking steel, then opening the terrain browser
won't override the current terrain directory any more. You can still click on
a regular terrain piece to open the terrain browser on its directory.

Fix #325: The default steel directory is images/geoo/steel/.

Fix #332: Tile groups will always be saved with relative coordinates that
are all >= 0, even when some of their parts have transparent boundaries.
(There is a bug left behind where tile groups with coordinates < 0 are loaded
wrongly on torus maps, but changing the interpretation of a level file affects
physics; thus, that second fix is postponed.)

0.9.14
------

2018-04-03

Waltz in C Sharp Miner, removed backroute.

Moved Arty's race maps (Heart of a Gambler, one map per player count, 2-8
players) from network/*p/arty to network/races/arty.

Fix #314, #315, #318: When you win a singleplayer game or win an edited
replay, either browser shows the game's stats under the preview and saves the
replay automatically. (These bugs were regressions after I removed the
end-of-singleplayer dialog.)

Fix: The command-line verifier generates checkmarks again.

0.9.13
------

2018-03-14

Close to the Edge, save 46/50->16/20. Building Block Maze, SI 32->50. The
Abominable Snowlix, save 15/30->5/10. Block Chaos, walkers 20->60, overtime
1:00->2:00.

Fix #312: Splat ruler option is now public. Choose one of three ruler designs.
Default is the 3-bar ruler with huge snap distance from 0.9.5 to 0.9.10.

Fix #308: Include Zanzindorf's lasers.

Fix #305: Autosave 4 pairs of savestates, not 3, on most maps, for performant
framestepping/multiplayer.

Fix #55: Remove dialog on winning singleplayer. You go to the browser
immediately after winning the level. Game pauses after losing, allowing you to
framestep backwards or restart with the regular commands. I hope this
satisfies the desire for a next-level button in the old dialog.

Fix #302: Remove end-of-multiplayer dialog. You go to the lobby immediately
after finishing a networking game. The lobby console shows the result, but I
plan to show better statistics here. This fixes the bug where observers were
shown instead of players in the end-of-multiplayer dialog.

Fix #309: Show indexing progress of the search dialog. I still don't cache the
search results; maybe the indexing feels still too slow on older computers
even when its progress is shown.

When you show FPS and Phyus, I don't display VRAM anymore. Reason: Once VRAM
got cached on huge maps, the Lix-estimated VRAM usage didn't match the real
VRAM usage anyway.

New build dependency, Optional type. This is a source-only dependency and is
automatically fetched by dub.

Batch file to build Lix on Windows conveniently by double-clicking.

0.9.12
------

2018-02-23

Multiplayer maps: Arty's Let Them Eat Cake (rename of Feaster Island),
Layer of Hell, Flopsy's Block Chaos, Nessy's Abandoned Sanctuaries.

lemforum: Some Cunning/Daunting levels reordered. This Lix, extra sawblade.
Bipolar Maniac, imploders 5->1 because the level is lose-1. Tribute to
Benny Hill, imploders 1->0.

On previewing/editing maps with more than 2.8 x 2^20 pixels (about 2.8
million pixels), Lix warns that these maps will likely crash. You can still
play and edit these maps normally. The warning is not perfect, but OK for now;
any real fix will be difficult.

Fix #229: Tooltips for all skills and all buttons during play.

Fix #306: `--fullscreen' command-line switch works again.

Allow the command-line parameter `--' to terminate switches. Subsequet
arguments will be interpreted as files even if they look like switches.

Linking on Linux: In dub.json, specify only `allegro-5', not `allegro', and
let dub use pkg-config to deduce linker flags (typically -lallegro).


0.9.11
------

2018-02-07

New multiplayer maps: Schism 2p by me, Team Attack 2p by Yung. Fixed exit
order in Pave the Way 4p.

Implemented geoo's design for a splat ruler with only two bars. Both bars snap
to terrain up to 16 pixels away. Hidden user option SPLAT_RULER_DESIGN in the
config file can be set to 0 for this ruler, or to 1 or 2 for the three-pronged
rulers from Lix 0.9.4 or 0.9.10.

Fix #220: On losing network connection, don't crash, but go back to the
Connect screen of the lobby.

Fix #297: In the singleplayer browser, removed the gap between the delete and
back buttons.

Fix #298: Option to invert the hold-to-scroll direction.

Fix #292: geoo/construction/Laser* flashes more clearly, to distinguish the
lasers frmo red abstract pipes.

Fix #303: Print names of missing tiles on the level preview.

Previews in level browsers downscale the level more smoothly.

Mitigate #296 (RAM balloons to 1.5 GB on Windows) without solving it:
Auto-savestate every 12 frames, not every 10, and keep 3 pairs, not 4.

Option to display torus seams is off by default.

In data/transl/*.txt, merged option titles and option descriptions in the same
line per option, instead of having two lines per option.

0.9.10
------

2018-01-30

Updated Arty's multiplayer maps, removed Knock 'em Dead, added Feaster Islands.

Fix #294: Loading manual savestates could occasionally desync physics.
This fix is covered with an automatic regression test.

Fix #295: Stateload won't preserve the future when you wish to discard
replay actions undone with framestepping. Covered with an automatic
regression test.

Fix #250: Permanent abilities appear as little icons over your own lix.

Slightly reduced Lix's hunger for RAM by running the garbage collection
more often. I still have to debug this gigantic hunger for RAM properly.
On large maps, Lix might want 1.5 GB on Windows and 500 MB on Linux.

Hardcoded the first miner eye position for the fuse and ability icons. Reason:
This miner pose covers the eye with her arm.

Don't paint over the level search button when the directory list updates.

Translated the search string "Search for filenames or level titles".

Removed the unused multiplayer jingles from data/sound/.

Editor shows coordinates only in decimal, not in hex. The map size dialog
still displays the size both in decimal and in hex.

Editor doesn't count exits in singleplayer maps, to improve the visible
difference between singleplayer and multiplayer maps.

Documented SiegeLord's batch file for the Windows build. Discourage installing
extra software on Windows merely to build 64-bit. 32-bit Lix runs fine and
is easier to build.

0.9.9
-----

2018-01-22

Added Arty's multiplayer maps: Knock 'em Dead, Pyramid Scheme, Pandemonium
Box. Modified Rubix's Access Denied to make it completely symmetric.

Fix #289: Replays that didn't point to levels, or even empty text files,
crashed the replay browser on highlight.

Fix #290: Fixed crash when running Lix from the quicklaunch bar on Windows.
Allegro 5 has an issue where the Windows sound driver depends on an active
display, and I assumed that the sound initialization would always succeed.
I've reordered my initializations and display an error message, not crash, in
case the sound driver still fails to initialize, which should be rare.

Fix #288: Added optional program-wide hotkey to take a screenshot of the
entire Lix window, saved in the export directory. No default keybinding.
Plays disksave.ogg on screenshotting.

Fix #291: Replay verifier called from the replay browser won't interrupt
the main menu music.

Fix #286: The player list in the multiplayer lobby won't draw over other parts
of the window.

The splat ruler isn't drawn while the mouse hovers over the panel. All three
colored bars of the ruler are drawn at 80 % opacity, not 100 %, to keep
terrain details visible behind. Activating splat ruler/exit ping doesn't play
a sound effect anymore.

Drew sunglasses icon and multiplayer nuke icon at scale 200 %.

Savestates during game play clock.ogg, not disksave.ogg, because they aren't
written to disk. disksave.ogg is always played quietly, not loudly, because
the sound file is extremely loud already.

0.9.8
-----

2018-01-15

lemforum: Lix Cannon, cover confusing gaps that were solid. Pipe Dream, remove
miners, improve lower route. Snow Jump, raise two pieces slightly.

Fix #285: Solving singleplayer replays are auto-terminated with a nuke if you
leave a game with ESC before the game is over.

Fix #281: Explain airclick to cancel replays in a tooltip.

When you scroll at the screen edge, a tooltip explains hold-to-scroll.

Fix #279: With music enabled, but no music installed, the main menu explains
how to download the music archive from the Lix website. Text will appear in
the corner of the screen, not as a dialog box.

Fix: Sound volume setting had no effect.

Editor shows mouse coordinates in the panel, in addition to the piece
coordinates that it has already shown before.

TAB is default binding for the splat ruler/exit ping. If you keep your old
user file, this change will not affect your bindings.

Removed unused hotkey to cycle spectated teams. When I have a better ingame
score board with player names, I'll think about how to implement this.

Removed unused strings from translation files in data/transl/. Each file lost
over 60 strings, mostly leftovers from C++ Lix.

0.9.7
-----

2018-01-03

lemforum: Path to Mahiman, fixed backroute by early bashing.

ClamLix: Swapped Inside the Fourth Wall with Urban Ledge-End. Applied mobius's
fix to Square Squabble from 2017-12-28.

Removed silent tile replacements, e.g., `moon.D' to `moon'. I've fixed about
20 levels that still used outdated tile names. I will make a pull request
against NepsterLix with these replacements.

Fix #276: Replay browser prints the pointed-to filename, to avoid confusion
what the pointedTo button does. I'd like to improve level-to-replay-matching
further.

Fix #278: Don't link against allegro_main on any system. Linking against that
produced warnings on Windows and program-terminating errors during dynamic
library loading on Mac.

Fix #114: Don't index tiles at program start, allow adding tiles to the tree
while Lix is running. This made the code far simpler. You still cannot change
tiles while Lix is running because the file is read only once, then cached.

Fix #275: When a basher ran out of earth to bash, some basher code ran on
walker memory, failing asserts in debugging mode. I don't believe this fix
changes physics, therefore no major version number bump.

Fix #41: Options menu offers hardware fullscreen. This shouldn't be used
normally, only when software fullscreen brings problems.

Fix #238: Lobby uses radio buttons for choice of server. We hide the manual
address field when central server is chosen.

Fix: The level-to-image exporter crashed when called from the command line.

Document where to download music in the main readme, in the detailed build
notes, and in the notes for package maintainers.

I ship the Windows binaries with newer Allegro libraries, their version is
now 5.2.3. Any Allegro 5.2.x should work well with Lix.

0.9.6
-----

2017-12-26

Added Raymanni's Holiday tileset. Thanks so much for this beautiful set!

Added multiplayer maps by IchoTolot. Removed my worst old multiplayer maps.

Rubix's singleplayer, reduced initial lix in 3 levels to combat long waits
when route is finished. Cropped small lemforum/Quirky maps with repeating
decoration from 640x400 to 640x320. Compression Method 2 has a 2nd hatch.

Fix #251: geoo/construction/pillar_* looks hexagonal instead of round, and
looks more like concrete, to avoid confusion with steel.

Fix #79: geoo/construction/squisher.T has a flashing exclamation sign and
looks different from pillar terrain. It's now clearer where terrain ends and
where the trap begins.

Fix #253: Level search matches the level author, too, not merely the level's
name and path.

Fix #222: When you enter a different windowed resolution, (un)check
windowed/fullscreen, or load a user config file, the program immediately
switches to the desired resolution and screen mode. You don't have to exit and
restart.

Fix #249: Editor, rectangle dragging: Prefer to drag 1xN rectangles instead of
(full-width)xN on torus maps.

Fix #219: On torus maps, editor draws hatch/goal annotations properly across
torus seams.

Fix: Restarting the level from the end-of-level dialog resets speed to normal.

Fix #226: Enforce datafiles (= on missing important files, print & log error
even in release mode), don't assert for datafiles

Log unplayable music only once per file per program start.

0.9.5
-----

2017-12-13

In NepsterLix/Moon, 10 levels got backroute fixes on 2017-11-30. All levels
are proven solvable.

In ClamLix/Outtakes, beautified Korean Border Crossing (version from
2017-12-13) and Abridged Version v1. All levels remain solvable.

Merged multiplayer maps by Arty: Blow Your Top, Shaft of Chaos, Showdown at
Chainsaw Gap.

Distinguished the pillars in matt/bricks from steel by yellow-brown color.
Still to do: Distinguish pillars in geoo/construction from steel.

Fix #272: Always draw splat ruler in front of terrain. Draw splat ruler even
when it doesn't snap to anything.

Fix #263, fix #269: Network game computes correct overtime when somebody
nukes before saving lix, then saves some. This fixes crashes from assertion
failures in the debugging build.

Fix #209: The replay verifier called from the replay browser creates
checkmarks when it finds solving replays whose player name matches the user's
name. Command-line verification doesn't create any checkmarks.

Fix #271: Verifier distinguishes normal failures without lix left from
failures from running more than 5 minutes after the final skill assignment.

Fix #157: Playing back winning replays on a wrong level version turned your
correct checkmarks into '?!'. Now, replays will only affect checkmarks when
the played level matches exactly.

Fix #260: When you interrupt or modify a replay, then save it, your name
replaces the old player name in the replay.

Better key names on Windows when remapping hotkeys. If you still see keycode
numbers instead of a proper key name, please tell me key and number.

Translated leftover options to German: Sound and music volume, fast movement
frees mouse, unpause on skill assignment.

Fixed links in the build instructions that were still pointing to asdfasdf;
they now point to lixgame.com.


0.9.4
-----

2017-11-30

ClamLix is included, a singleplayer pack with 113 levels. All levels are
proven solvable. Thanks, Clam, Forestidia, and mobius!

New multiplayer maps by Arty, Flopsy, and Yung. In particular, more maps for 7
and 8 players. Some fixes to multiplayer maps by geoo and Steve.

lemforum's Eye of the Needle: removed a backroute. Rubix's Holly Jingle: save
99/99 -> save 10/10.

Restarting a level disables fast-forward or turbo-fast-forward.

Fix #267: Allow multiple hotkeys per skill.

Fix #257: When A's lix enters B's exit, B will hear the saving sound.

Splat ruler. In multiplayer, the splat ruler is combined with the
exit-highlighting-function. Needs feedback.

Score graph marks players who nuked with black-and-white squares. Ideally, I
find a better solution.

Fix: Disable editor grid-size hotkey whenever an editor window is open.

Fixed an assertion failure in the debugging build when dragging quickly in the
editor.

Fix #258: The multiplayer server crashed when somebody left, then the
remaining players started a game. Still needs field testing.

0.9.3
-----

2017-11-18

Music: Download https://www.lixgame.com/dow/lix-music.zip and extract
into your Lix root dir. You can create additional subfolders in ./music/
and put your own tracks inside -- ideally as .ogg, .mod, .xm, .it, or .s3m.
Lix will play a random track per level.

Fix #216: The manual savestate function will now always overwrite the
savestate replay with the current replay.

Improved the mouse handling on Windows, there should be fewer odd jumps
of Lix's cursor over half the game window.

When you restart a level during pause, the game unpauses.

0.9.2
-----

2017-10-22

Rubix reordered his singleplayer levels and added the Community Collab
Project: 4 levels in single/rubix/Extras.

lemforum: Path to Mahiman, removed indirect jump backroute. Runaround up to
Cunning, Raindow Road down to Quirky.

Fix #252: Level search queries won't match the prefix 'levels/' in the
filenames because all levels would match.

Fix #256: When you export levels to images or save replays manually, the
button replacement will not say "done", but instead tell you the filename.

Fix #254: When you run out of VRAM during a level, the game won't crash, but
instead stop making internal savestates. This won't display a warning, it will
merely log. Recalculation due to incoming network packets will take longer,
but that's better than crashing. The game remains VRAM-hungry and this
solution is not ideal.

0.9.1
-----

2017-10-05

Fix #243: Sounds play in the lobby or browser when somebody joins or when
somebody picks a map. When observers browse for maps and others start a game,
the observer's browser closes, and the observer will see the game.

Fix #244: Malformed UTF-8 in files within the level tree (e.g., zip archive)
won't crash the Lix level search anymore. The offending file still will not
appear as a searchable level; instead, the offending filename is logged. I
validate all keyboard input for UTF-8.

Fix #246: Tiles with coordinates far out-of-bounds crashed the editor once
torus wrapping became enabled. Will now torus-wrap these tiles properly.

Fix #247: The lix under the mouse is lighlighted far brighter and gets a dark
outline to its left, right, and above it.

Fix #248: Multiplayer colors: Purple is lighter. Black is darker. Yellow is
darker and has less green hue.

Removed a backroute in lemforum's Duality from abusing decoration.

Added about 40 remakes by Proxima of maps from 2009. I've
inserted the maps in their original authors' directories.

Removed hidden water in Sharing the Water Supply 4p. Removed duplicate map
files for Going Up 7p/8p.

0.9.0
-----

2017-09-28

Raymanni's Toy, Lab, and Gore tilesets to v3: Raymanni has drawn Lab monitors,
Gore tentacles, eyes, and a bonesaw, a Toy chalkbox, and several more. All
tiles have shading from the top-left as normal for Lix tiles. Thanks!

Added Proxima's and mobius's multiplayer levels, merged geoo's level changes
for the tileset update.

Level search.

Fix #230: Frogs ate cubers, and flung cubers reanimated. Now, cubers stay dead.

Fix #231: Tumblers oscillated in thin walls. Now, tumblers will either move or
land. (The tumbler code is not perfect yet, I'm planning to rewrite it, but
the rewrite's subtle physics changes would invalidate too many replays still.)

Fix #214: Players permute correctly in networking games.

Fix #239: The server sends a permutation of correct size. This fixes wrong
hatch/goal distributions in games with many observers and larger teams.

Fix #217: Skip remaining overtime when everybody has nuked or finished
playing.

Race maps (= maps that have zero overtime) nuke automatically on the first
scoring.

Fix #240: Observers don't have to cancel the end-of-game dialog anymore. I
print the game result to the console. This is not beautiful, but it's an
acceptable medium-term solution.

0.8.8
-----

2017-09-24

(Still 0.8.5 physics: This 0.8.8 still has the severe bug where you can fling
cubers and thereby reanimate them, leading to wrong counts of lix alive. 0.9
will fix this.)

Merged 9 new multiplayer maps by Colorful Arty. Merged multiplayer map updates
by geoo.

All racing maps, and geoo's Tower Defense 22934, have zero overtime. All other
maps have nonzero overtime.

The ping button highlights both your hatches and your exits in multiplayer.

Multiplayer colors: Orange and yellow are more distinct. Grey is lighter. Blue
and black are darker.

Warn about fewer key collisions in the the options tab for hotkeys in menus.

Linux packaging: You can override the XDG install path with a custom path, see
doc/build/package.txt. In the git repository, data/images/lix_logo.svg has a
large logo as SVG. I don't ship that in the download because it's over 3 MB.

0.8.7
-----

2017-09-19

The out-of-skills beep was too trigger-happy: When we clicked a mining lix
and had miners left in the skill panel, the game beeped as if we were out of
skills. Fixed.

0.8.6
-----

2017-09-19

Fix #227: Lobby player list shows 8 entries at a time and scrolls. Before, it
let the the 9th, 10th, ..., button bleed underneath the list.

Fix #228: Edge scrolling requires the hardware mouse inside the window.

Fix #229: Pressing the hotkey of an empty skill deselects all skills instead
of keeping the previous selection.

Included Rubix's variants on Marble Run, Eater Island, Diagonal 8p, and
removed dead space on Across the Gap. Everybody else: Post your multiplayer
maps, then I can include them in the next version.

Optionally print during play the number of physics updates, frames per second,
and a ballpark guess of allocated VRAM.

0.8.5
-----

2017-09-09

Fix #244: Grouping certain tiles led to an assertion failure: The game
attempted to cut the group like a gridded animation. Fixed.

Most of #216: Ping button: A small button in multipalyer games, next to the
nuke. Button clicks highlight all own goals for 4 seconds by flashing them
inside black and white boxes above the terrain. Can be hotkeyed; by default,
no key is bound.

Fix #162: In the hotkey options, if you bind the same key twice, all its
bindings show in red. You can decide whether to remove one binding or keep
all.

Fix: When the editor inserts a tile from the terrain browser into a level, the
tile will be aligned to the grid.

I enforce bitmap creation: If you run out of VRAM, Lix should now terminate
with a proper exception, not crash later in unrelated functions. If you crash,
screenshot the error, or send me [tt]data/log.txt[/tt].

I optimized the lix Job hierarchy for speed: Lixes are value types, and carry
their job as a value type within themselves. (Drawing many exploder fuses at
once is still slow. Organ Symphony will still kill the framerate.)

Fix #211: On Linux, you can pass a compiler switch to make Lix system-wide
installable, follwing the XDG base directory structure. For arbitrary
installation paths, open an issue on github.

0.8.4
-----

2017-08-30

Fix #4 and #213: Some graphics cards cannot load textures wider or taller than
4096 pixels. Amanda's tar and occult hatch were too wide. Now, I allow
two-dimensional spritesheets for single-animation gadgets, and I've
rearranged the frames in the tar and occult hatch. In Lix, looks and physics
should be unaffected.

lemforum: Over the Hump out, Duality in. Duality and Round Trip swap places
within Daunting.

5 new multiplayer maps by Rubix.

0.8.3
-----

2017-08-27

Fix #176: Make a tile group with at least one non-dark tile where all non-dark
tiles are covered entirely by dark tiles. This crashed the game before. This
crash is now fixed.

Fix #191: Initial zoom on tall narrow maps (e.g., Rubix's Hamunaptra for 4
players) is fit-to-height, or zoom 1 if fit-to-height would zoom even further
out. Initial zoom on small narrow maps (e.g., The Runaround) fits the entire
map on the screen, obviating scrolling, allowing dark borders.

Merged editor's Topology and Looks dialogs into a single new Map dialog.
No new functionality yet. I'm thinking about custom screen starts.

For a new player, the singleplayer browser highlights Any Way You Want,
the first map of the lemforum pack.

lemforum, Forest of Fears: Wider exit platform, should look less cramped now.

0.8.2
-----

2017-08-24

Fixed magic crash: The Wine build, in release mode, run in Wine but not in
Windows, crashed on entering a nonexistant user name. This would have been
very bad because can't do anything on new installation before entering a name.
The fix is pure magic, a mere rearrangement of lines. Fixed for safety, even
though it was OK in Windows.

0.8.1
-----

2017-08-24

The save-as browser (used by the editor to save levels) allows to create
new directories.

Editor defaults to 30 seconds of overtime on new levels. Singleplayer levels
discard their time.

Removed hints during levels and manual screen start.

Rebevelled [tt]matt/underworld/{00,01,02}.png[/tt]: Better shading, these
bricks don't look flattened near their left edge anymore.

lemforum: Sinking Ship, geoo is author. namida written in only small letters.
Setting a Fundament, renamed to Cubic Interpolation. Forest of fears, removed
2 backroutes.

0.8.0
-----

2017-08-22

Stable 0.7.22 physics. I would like to keep these physics at least for several
months.

Tooltips during game explain directional select, priority invert,
and double-click on nuke. Can disable tooltips in the options menu.

Removed the unused editor button to add decoration. To fill the void,
the button to add terrain is twice as large. Not perfect, but good for now.

0.7.22
------

2017-08-20

Physics: Flinging downwards initializes pixelsFallen with the distance that
speed-0 tumblers normally fall before reaching the given speed. Still, all
flinging overwrites pixelsFallen without respect to earlier values. Tumblers
splat when pixelsFallen on impact is larger than 126.

Re-introduced downwards steam and the 2016 decoration on Goblin City, Gomen
ne, 100 Ways to Die.

Digger unchanged since 0.7.19: Still 5/9 with anti-razor-edging. Discussing.

lemforum: Bulldozer out, Sinking Ship v2 in. Empty Space reverted to the 2014
version, rejecting both propesed versions from 2017. Renamed Cuber Replacement
to Jack in the Box.

0.7.21
------

2017-08-18

Fix: The last exiter didn't play the exiter sound.

Renamed Rubix's "Just a Minute... (Part three)" to "Come on Down! The Price Is
Right", which is almost too long but still fits well.

Removed lemforum/wip-0.7/ and images/geoo/construction/chain1.png, the
now-obsolete tile because its size doesn't conform to multiples of 8.
[url=https://www.lixgame.com/etc/unused-levels-0.7.zip]Download unused levels
and chain1[/url].

Removed simon/wood/ tileset. I've replaced these tiles with Matt's wooden
planks in the 3 multiplayer levels by Rubix used them:
Going Up, Coming Down (2p); Naoh's Ark (2p), Naoh's Ark (Team).

0.7.19
------

2017-08-16

Physics: Digger has anti-razor-edging: Whenever a digger ignores steel, he
cannot remove earth pixels beyond the steel in the same row. (The digger stays
at 5/9 steel sensitivity, i.e., chokes on steel in the central 10 of 18 hi-res
pixels and continues despite steel in the outermost 4 hi-res pixels on either
side.)

Updated lemforum's Down Among the Dead Lix, Let's All Go Down the Strand,
Division of Labor, Empty Space is Hardly a Waste (Proxima's 2017-08-15
version). Theresa v2 has been up-to-date since 0.7.16.

Merged Rubix's remakes of The Clairvoyant and Flatlined. Thanks!

Removed the downwards steam. I adapted the decoration in the only 3 lemforum
levels that used downwards steam: Giblin City, Gomen Ne, 100 Ways To Die.
(Downwards transportation beams are slow, not intended to kill, and therefore
still in the game.)

In the editor, you can delete tiles by dragging them onto the panel. While
hovering over the panel with dragged tiles, the mouse cursor becomes a
trashcan and the tiles become invisible.

Fix: Drag tiles around in the editor, tap the tile-deleting hotkey, and
continue to drag around nothing. The game crashed. Fixed by stopping the
dragging on deleting a selection.

Fix #174: The ingame level map, during non-integral zoom, sometimes
didn't initialize/overwrite outside rows of pixels. Fixed by rounding up.

Fix #201: The ingame level map during large integral zoom that didn't
divide the length of the map, didn't initialize/overwrite outside rows of
pixels. Fixed by rounding up.

0.7.18
------

2017-08-12

Tumblers remember how many pixels they have moved downwards since (they got
flung for the last time, or since they moved upwards, whatever of these
happened later). When non-floatable tumblers hit the ground, they splat if the
fallen hi-res pixels exceed 126. They ignore the y-speed for splatting.

I've drawn 4 new digger frames before the animation loop begins.

In multiplayer, when overtime starts, the bell sounds and the console warns
about how much time will be left before the nuke.

0.7.17
------

2017-08-10

100 % proof coverage for lemforum and NepsterLix! Thanks to all who submit
replays. The coverage is for the 5/9 digger.

Rubix's singleplayer levels are almost covered: 155/157. Uncovered levels are
The Clairvoyant and Flatlined, these Oriental levels need an overhaul due to
tileset breakage. I'll PM Rubix. Removed The More You Know because that's a
nuke level, but D Lix locks the exits during the nuke. Lowered initial lix on
many levels.

No decision yet for the digger. 5/9 is implemented. I'm leaning towards
keeping this 5/9 digger, but I want to read over yesterday's chatlogs again
and Proxima might post to the 0.7-steel-sensitivity topic.

0.7.16
------

2017-08-09

All water gadgets in images/simon have multiples of 16 for their sizes: 48x48
or 48x32 or 48x16. The old water size was 50x50. I've looked through all
singleplayer levels -- lemforum, NepsterLix, and Rubix -- and fixed the few
water placements that had not yet looked good with 48x48.

All triggered gadgets (triggered traps and triggered flingers) have two rows
of animations: The first row loops while idle, the second row plays while
busy. After the final frame of the second row has played, the gadget will
eat another lix and jump back to the frontmost frame of the second row, or,
if nobody is in range, begin looping the idling animation from the front.

Kept digger at 5/9 sensitivity for now: Digger chokes on steel when the
innermost 10 of 18 pixels contain any steel. I should make a final decision
this week.

Rubix's singleplayer levels, Perplexing: Lowered initial lix on some levels.
Coverage 108/158 -> 119/158, need 39 more.

Get Hype and Theresa V2 merged into lemforum from the 0.7-lemforum thread.
lemforum coverage is 239/240, need 1 more: Theresa V2.

0.7.15
------

2017-08-04

Revert basher mask: Bottom 16 pixels are steel-sensitive, not only the
bottom 13. I.e., we have 2, not 5, insensitive pixels over the sensitive.

Replay verifier logs to `data/verifier.txt' and closes the file after
writing its last line or after closing the dialog.

0.7.14
------

2017-08-02

Proxima's planned changes to the lemforum pack. Snowball Battle: Spawn
interval 20->22, to keep it solvable.

0.7.13
------

2017-08-01

Physics: The basher ignores steel in its top 5/18 rows, not merely 2/18.
The digger ignores steel in its 4 outermost hi-res pixels on both sides,
not merely in its outermost 2 on each side. The digger digs every (16*n)
frames following its assignment, not already every (16*n - 4).

Fixed bug #202: Small levels image-export with all stats again, not only
with their skills.

0.7.12
------

2017-07-31

lemforum pack: Simple renamed to Lovely. Some backwards-compatibility code
that converts progress checkmarks during loading the user file.

lemforum/wip-0.7 has all levels in consideration for lemforum pack's stable
release with 0.7.x in 2 weeks. I hope all levels are up-to-date.

Raymanni's 3 water tiles have higher trigger areas. (Lixes drown earlier and
higher up than before when they drop into the water.)

Zoom 1x is always allowed, even if the level doesn't fill the available area.

Fix #206: Editor browsers show the innermost directory of hatches, goals,
traps, and other gadgets.

Goals are locked during the nuke. The nuke is purely for decoration and
to finish replays in style.

Mouse code reverted to the 0.6 mouse code. If anybody has trouble, tell me.

Keyboard key duration before first repeat for moving selected editor
pieces: 0.33 seconds -> 0.2 seconds.

Lots of multiplayer nuke code that handles conceding and calling for the nuke.
When you press the nuke button, you lose control over your lix, overtime
starts, but your lix don't explode yet. We'll see how it feels.

Editor allows to set overtime in multiplayer levels. Existing multiplayer
levels are tagged with the correct player number.

0.7.11
------

When you want to nuke, you can't assign skills anymore. The game core dismisses
assignments after your nuke, and the GUI shows zero skills.

Game doesn't show FPS in the panel by default. It's an option still.

0.7.10
------

2017-07-17

Updated lemforum/Vicious/_order.X.txt, ordering One-Lix Showdown.

0.7.9
-----

2017-07-17

Physics change:
Reverted the physics change from 0.7.8: The walker skill behaves like in 0.6
again. Either the lix cancels her activity and walks on, or turns.

Shotgun-debugged mobius's mouse problem by applying a Linux workaround for
all systems. I couldn't test, hope this helps.

More lemforum level pack coverage. Only 7 levels left to cover:
fromtheotherside.txt metalcitymayhem.txt thecontinuum.txt
dreamtheimpossible.txt lixsterquadrille.txt survivalofthecraft.txt
toccata.txt

0.7.8
-----

2017-07-01

Physics change:
0.6 walker: If target lix is working, revert to walker. Otherwise, turn.
0.7.8 walker: If target lix is working, revert to walker. Turn in every case.

0.7.6
-----

2017-06-20

Fix: Builders and platformers duplicate bricks for free when turning at
blockers. Before, number bricks left decreased for these extra bricks.

0.7.5
-----

2017-06-20

lemforum: Completely Ridiculous Level is narrower by 48 pixels.
203/240 levels are proven solvable in 0.7 physics, let's cover 37 more.

Down-facing tumblers drown head-first, not feet-first.

0.7.4
-----

2017-06-14

simon/oriental/bonsai: This tree got lixes stuck beneath its leaves.
Changed some pixels and therefore the tree's physics. Didn't affect any
levels for the worse.

Rubix's Pleasand and Sinister are 100 % covered. The higher difficulties
aren't covered yet.

When you verify dirs in the replay browser, that dir becomes the most recent
dir for exiting and restarting the browser.

0.7.3
-----

2017-06-14

NepsterLix is 100 % solvable with 0.7.2 physics.

The replay browser offers a button "Verify dir" that verifies all replays
in the current directory, recursing through subdirectories. Lix shows the
results in the GUI and copies them to the logfile.

0.7.2
-----

2017-06-11

Blocker field is back like in 0.6: LLLLLL-RRRRRR against everything.
This is simplest and allows crowd-follows-builder in at least 70 % of the
cases.

0.7.1
-----

2017-05

Blocker fields by geoo's suggestion, LLLLLL-RRRRRR against nonbuilders and
LLLLL---RRRRR against builders.

0.7.0
-----

2017-05

Lots of changes, see experimental version thread on lemmingsforums.com.

0.6.39
------

2017-07-01

The replay browser allows you to batch-verify all replays in the current
directory. The results are printed on screen and to the logfile.

Fixed 3 backroutes in NepsterLix; the changed levels are A Day in Lixtown,
House of the Mad Trickster, and No Matter What I Try.

0.6.38
------

2017-05-14

Fixed #158: When you exported levels as images from the game and your game's
resolution was not 640x480, the images had blank stripes instead of skillbars.

Editor draws teams on hatches and goals. (Bug: When you have fewer gadgets
of either type than teams, only the first team will be drawn.)

Editor terrain browser shows more tiles with smaller buttons.

0.6.37
------

2017-04-29

Codebase builds with dmd 2.074.

Fix #197: Create a new level, never save, then instruct the editor to exit.
When the editor asks about potential data loss, choose to save. The buttons
in the save browser didn't work, the level was lost. This is now fixed.

Fix #198: When the editor inserts a tile from a browser, the new tile
aligns to the grid.

0.6.36
------

2017-04-28

Re-enable the option to untrap mouse with fast movement. I have a kludgy fix
against the buggy mouse jump (Arch 2016, Allegro 5.2, my old code or Allegro
generated extra move events when I merely wanted to warp the mouse).
* This kludge is only helpful when you always trap the mouse inside Lix.
* If you allow the mouse to leave with fast movement, you'll still have a
    warp when you begin right-click scrolling. Need kludge on top of kludge?
* The kludge is only active on Linux, I've static-if'd it away elsewhere.

0.6.35
------

2017-04-25

Fix #183: Multiplayer panel shows only number of saved, not any requirement.
We can still improve this later, e.g., by showing the score of the best
opponent.

Fix #180: Chat during play implemented.

Fix #181: Chat message length is unlimited. The entry box scrolls along.

Fix #146: Skill arrows scale only once. There are only 1x-zoomed arrows,
they are drawn straight to the map, then scroll and zoom along with the
terrain. Maybe GUI-scaled arrows should move as GUI components along with
the scrolling, but that would be very hard and force frequent total redraws.

0.6.34
------

2017-04-16

Fix #192: While you are in the multiplayer level browser, incoming console
messages don't overwrite the browser anymore.

Fix #194: Show both the score bar graph and the tape recorder buttons
when you watch a saved multiplayer replay.

Fix #195: Client shows version mismatch in their console when they attempt to
connect to a server running an incompatible version. Versions X.Y.Z are
compatible iff they have the same X and the same Y. The patch version Z
doesn't matter.

Fixed asserts in the delayed exploder code. Undelayed, lix explode in the next
fame following their assignment. Delayed exploders explode in the 75-th-next
frame after the assignment, this is 74 frames later than undelayed.

Removed my desert tileset (images/simon/desert). It has become unacceptable
MS-Paint programmer art. Almost nobody used it. The levels "Hrududu" and
"Group Therapy" used it for decoration, I have re-decorated them in similar
style. The asymmetric multiplayer maps "Shine On You Crazy Lix" used desert
for the main terrain. I won't ship these until they're redesigned; this is
a good opportunity to fix the advantage of the higher-spawning players.

0.6.33
------

2017-04-14

Fix #182: Timed exploders in multiplayer have a nice burning fuse. I examine
the spritesheet for the eye position. The fuse burns slow at the beginning,
then faster when it's short, for visibility.

Fix #193: Most opponents' sounds aren't played. Opponents' deaths and baseball
bats still play sounds.

Fix #168: Server resets all room data once a room is empty, and deallocates
the level. Before, you could find old levels when entering a new room.

NaOH's forest exit has animated candles. Physics remain identical.

Singleplayer nuke buttons don't have a red background anymore. I want to
redesign multiplayer nuke buttons, e.g., by printing overtime on them.

0.6.32
------

2017-04-11

Partly fix #182: Draw a rudimentary exploder flame over the lix's head
in multiplayer. I don't draw a fuse yet, and I don't examine the spritesheet
for the exact eye position.

Fix #190: Override "asdfasdf.ethz.ch" with "lixgame.com" in outdated
config files left behind by C++ Lix.

0.6.31
------

2017-04-06

Fix #186: Observers can't assign skills even locally.

Fix #58: Option to keep replay actions after framestepping backwards over them,
this is enabled by default. mobius likes to remove them on framestepping.

Don't float-downscale UI CutbitElements, always display at integer scale >= 1.

Removed images/matt/oriental/dragon.png. That tile was huge, clashed
in style with other pieces, and is nowhere used.

0.6.30
------

2017-03-30

Fix #184: Observing players don't add colors to the game. There is still a
bug with observers: The can assign skills, changing their own replay, even
though others won't interpret these assignments.

Maybe fix #177: Multiplayer or state-loaded singleplayer produced outdated
land, even though physics were correct. Copying the land without transparency
should fix that.

0.6.29
------

2017-03-29

Moved gamestate memory management from GC with manual GC calls to reference
counting. Maybe that fixes #177, outdated terrain during multiplayer?

Fix #179: Unfocus lobby chat when a game starts.

Fix #178: Don't flash the R for replaying during multiplayer.

Fix #185: Hotkeyed zoom during multiplayer, even if the button isn't shown.

Fix #171: Terrain browser doesn't upscale small tiles.

0.6.28
------

2017-03-18

First version for the networking test on lemmingsforums.net.

Removed the option to untrap the mouse with quick mouse movements. This
option was buggy on linux and has always required workarounds. To untrap
the mouse now, press Alt+Tab.

Matt's winter hatch has no snow, but wooden triangles.

0.6.27
------

2017-03-16

In multiplayer, the server sends time-syncing packets to all players in a
room. This happens every 0.5 seconds during the first few seconds in the game,
and every 5 seconds later on. Players adjust their physics' speed to match.
Even if players open the ESC menu, a networked game will continue to run.

0.6.26
------

2017-03-09

NepsterLix 1.6 is an excellent singleplayer puzzle pack with 106 levels.
It was released in 2016, now it's finally included in the main download.

Sharper small text on small resolutions such as 800x600 and below: Instead
of small shadow text, I print small text with a dark outline.

More networking code: Transferring and interpreting game data works.
Can't interrupt other players' replay actions anymore. Game's network
connection is picked up by lobby after game. But the server doesn't yet
send time-syncing packets every few seconds, thus clients will time-shift.

0.6.25
------

2017-03-05

The Windows executable has a Lix icon in the file manager. On all operating
systems, the application window and taskbar entry have a Lix icon.

0.6.24
------

2017-03-04

Fix #167: Editor button zooms again. Map is rezoomed when editor resizes map.

Fix #170: Game crashed due to the Nurse indexing players in the replay by
PlNr. Now, the replay uses a PlNr-indexed associative array.

I offer more zoom values: 1/sqrt(2), 1, sqrt(2), 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 16, and
fitting the level's width or height to screen.

0.6.23
------

2017-03-02

Fewer zooms are considered similar. This addresses Nepster's concerns:
https://www.lemmingsforums.net/index.php?topic=3128.msg63116#msg63116

Fix #169: I validate all user files for good UTF-8 before calling Phobos.

Implemented the transparent console for networking messages during play.

I've worked on starting networking games and transferring game data.
I haven't tested this yet, don't expect anything yet.

0.6.22

When you zoom in or out, the mouse points to the same pixel on the land
before and after the zoom. Exception: Map scrolling is restricted on low zoom.

Fix: In-game map boundary was sometimes too thin, there was a 1-pixel wide
column or row of non-erased pixels between the boundary and the land.

Fix #94: Show spawn interval only when hovering over a hatch. I'm showing
it in the panel still, not laid over the hatch, which would have been better.

If a map is taller than wide, it tries to fit its width to the screen width,
not the height.

Merged a contribution by CyberShadow to upscale the 640x480 GUI icons
for high resolutions by integer factors when no high-res icon exists. Thanks!

Initial zoom fits the level height on the screen height, allowing horizontal
scrolling if the map is very wide. Exception: The map is only slightly wider
than the screen, then initial zoom fits the width on the screen width,
generating a black border at the top.

When you increase the zoom factor, the game centers on the mouse cursor.

0.6.20

Code compiles with dmd 2.073: Masks initialize at runtime, before main menu.
I removed tharsis.prof, that dependency didn't build with dmd 2.072.

Reworkings under the hood towards minimum viable multiplayer. In case you
have replays from old C++ Lix, you can watch them in D Lix now. But you still
cannot start multiplayer games yet in D Lix.

0.6.19
------

2016-11-01

I require Allegro 5.2 now instead of 5.0.

Included Rubix's levels. They're all solvable in D Lix.

Fix #159: Better encapsulation for physics caching. Don't switch timelines
merely by framestepping back. Maybe this fixes Rubix's sporadic crashes, #154.

Fix #24: GUI text vertically centered on buttons. I'd like to see how this
looks on Windows machines.

More work on the networking lobby. You can chat, browse rooms, send and receive
levels, but can't start a game yet.

0.6.18
------

2016-10-08

Fix: When you picked a tile from the editor's tile browsers, the tile wouldn't
appear in the level. Now it does again.

0.6.17
------

2016-09-21

Fix #153: I have culled the no-effect decoration. The still decoration is now
solid terrain. Animated decoration is gone, except for the beach bonfire, which
became a fire trap. I have changed levels that I distribute with the game to
use the new tiles. Backwards compatibility for levels that I don't maintain:
The level loading function silently replaces decoration with the new tiles.

I removed the auto-replacements for Matt's terrain that I made in 2010 and
2011. Almost no levels relied on them anymore, and I've changed the remaining
two levels that did. These levels remain functionally identical.

Fix #156: Switching to a parent directory in the singleplayer browser clears
the preview again.

Rubix has created a cute sound for (singleplayer, you have lost too many lix).
It's included, and plays once when triggered, not five times like the old tick.

The warning sound for empty skill doesn't play on mouse click, only on hotkey.

0.6.16
------

2016-09-14

Fix #152: The singleplayer browser has a button to create a new level.
This button is always visible, whether a level is selected or not.

Fixed smearing FPS text in the editor.

0.6.15
------

2016-09-13

Started networking backend, lobby, and console. You can log onto the central
server at lixgame.com and chat.

Fix #145: The editor calced twice after its boxes lost focus. You could cancel
a box with a hotkey, and the editor interpreted the hotkey itself once more.

Fix #151: When there is no savestate, the state-load button is hidden.

Fast movement frees mouse: This option is off by default.

0.6.14
------

2016-09-01

Command-line switches to jump into play:
    lix level.txt                plays the level.
    lix replay.txt               plays the replay against its included level.
    lix --pointed-to replay.txt  plays the replay against its pointed-to level.
    lix level.txt replay.txt     plays the replay against the given level.

Minor bugs left behind here: Depending on from where the levels are run,
they do or don't generate checkmarks. Auto-replays should always be saved,
even if, when not run from the root directory, the replays are called unknown.

Command-line switch to export images. The following command-line exports as
images the two given levels, and all levels recursively found in mydir:
    lix --image level1.txt level2.txt mydir

Fix #149: Singleplayer always displays a dialog at end of play again,
so you can control the entire application with the mouse alone. You can
framestep back from this dialog.

0.6.13
------

2016-08-27

Lemforum levels got updates from August 2016. I deleted the tutorial levels:
The lemforum pack is our flagship pack and starts with very easy levels.
Other packs need not provide tutorial levels.

Fix #142: There is a virtual file system. It recognizes ./ and ../ now.
Other directories, in particular installations in Linux File System Hierarchy
trees, aren't supported yet, but the necessary changes have become easy.

Fix #148: When you fail a singleplayer level, the game halts and allows you
to go back in time. It doesn't spawn a dialog box anymore.

Fix #144: In the editor, when you mirrored a piece with transparent pixels at
its sides, the piece moved. Entire selections diverged on repeated mirroring.

Fix #84 and #90: The options menu explains its options, except on the editor
tab. The box near the menu's bottom provides two lines of explanation.

0.6.12
------

2016-08-07

Fix #134: Select multiple tiles in the editor and press rotate.
The tiles rotate correctly with respect to each other. Rotating 4 times
puts them back exactly where they started, they don't wander. This works
even if oddly-sized tiles or unrotatable gadgets are in the selection.

Fix #139: The browsers for hatches, goals, decoration, and hazards display
all tiles in the images/ tree in one listing.

Fix #140: The terrain browser starts browsing from the directory of the
tile you have selected at the moment. If you haven't selected anything,
they start from the directory from which you've most recently added a tile.

Fix #143: The file selector scrolls to the final row, even if it's less
than half-filled. Before, the scrollbar looked like there were more files,
but didn't make the tiler display these extra files.

Swapped author and level title in the editor's constant-setting window.

0.6.11
------

2016-08-06

lemforum pack: Many updates by Proxima and geoo. Fewer lix in Hopeless.
geoo has rebuilt Spin Geometry with completely new terrain, and renamed it
to All Aboard the Pain Train. Off the Rails is now Railroad Plot, and
Derailed Level got a derailing locomotive as decoration.

Fix #117: Name-asking menu for new players exits with plain Esc. I don't
display anything for this.

Fix #131 and #111: Simpler starting zoom. Depending on your game
resolution, either all levels start as 1x or all levels start as 2x. Test
and see if you like the zoom for your resolution.

Fix #122: When you continue from a saved replay, then win, or save
manually, the new replay goes into the correct directory and points to the
correct level file.

Fix #133: The singleplayer menu shows the player's best score: Lix saved
and skills used.

Fix #138: Editor hotkeys work even while you're dragging. The buttons on
screen are disabled for the mouse during drag.

Fix #127: I hide dot-files, like .git, in level directories.

0.6.10
------

2016-07-31

In the lemforum pack, 237 of all 240 levels are guaranteed to be solvable.
The remaining possibly-unsovable levels are Trading and Cooperating,
The Mile High Club, and Striking News at Ten.

Fix #116: Editor shows the top-left point of a multiple selection, the minimal
coordinate each in both the x- and y-direction.

Fix #130: After state-loading a different timeline, framestepping moved back
to the undesired timeline. Now, I discard old savestates until the merge base
of the two timelines, and recompute from there on savestate.

Fix #91: Editor buttons are disabled when dragging.

0.6.9
-----

2016-07-27

Miners throw their pickaxe into the air when they hit steel.

Option: Do fast mouse movements untrap the mouse from windowed Lix?

lemforum pack updated by Proxima, again first 5 ranks solvable.

0.6.8
-----

2016-07-22

Decoration updated on Any Way You Want, The Road Goes Ever On, Just Stop
the Bleeding.

Fix #125: disksave.ogg was too loud, changed from 0 dBFS to -4.5 dBFS.

0.6.7
-----

2016-07-22

The lemforum pack's first 5 ranks are guaranteed to be solvable. geoo has
given maintenance of the lemforum pack to Proxima. Proxima has spent days
on careful level adaption to D Lix and difficulty reordering.
Out: Get Down From There, Minimalism Part 3.
In: Don't Look Back (jagged floor instead of a time-limit gadget),
    Canadian Glade (inspired by Get Down From There, uses the forest tileset).

Fix #111: Initial zoom on torus maps was too zoomed in.

Fix #112: Hotkey labels ran over nearby buttons.

Fix #118: When Lix wasn't the foreground window, it trapped the mouse
nonetheless when the cursor passed over the inactive window. Now, you must
click into the window to trap the mouse. This fix made visible another bug:
In the inactive Lix, the ingame cursor moves offset from the hardware cursor.

Worked on #124: I don't add 0x0 as a fullscreen mode anymore.

0.6.6
-----

2016-07-17

The lemforum community pack has Proxima's suggestions up to 2016-07-17.
Several levels have moved between ranks. Some have been replaced entirely:
Out: Minimalism (Part 1), Fear of Heights, That Pesky Gap, Don't Look Back,
    Too Far to Walk
In: A Necklace of Raindrops, The Road Not Taken, All Around the World,
    Diggin' the Air, A Soulful Bounding Leap

--coverage switch to use along with --verify, to compute level directory
coverage. From all levels that reside in level directories from where you
have tested at least one pointed-to level of a replay with --verify,
--coverage lists those levels that didn't enjoy even a single solution.
Please read levmaint.txt for detailed instructions. Example command line:

    lix --verify=replays/path/to/dir --coverage

Fix #113: Shorter key names with unicode symbols. In particular, keys on
the numeric pad have a nice symbol that looks like the keypad.

Fix #120: Topology updates correct equation, not only the horizontal equation

Some assertions to debug issue #121 on MacOS.

0.6.5
-----

2016-07-03

Fix #103: When you re-enter the window, the ingame mouse starts moving from
where the hardware mouse entered the window.

Fix #108: Adventure Playground displays again in the preview and is playable.

The replay browser has two buttons to start replays: One replays against the
included level, one replays against the pointed-to level.

Updated the lemforum community pack to geoo89/lixlfpack commit 2a91852.
This reorders some levels. Two levels have been replaced entirely:
Out: Three Days of the Condor, Absolute Zero
In: Lixes in Motion, Eye of the Needle

Afterwards, the lemforum pack got fewer initial lix in the lower three ratings
Simple, Quirky, Cunning. Proxima has played all these levels, tested for
solvability under a fixed spawn interval, and recommended lower initial lix
counts that keep the level idea fully intact. We have removed about 2,000 lix.

0.6.4
-----

2016-06-27

Editor increases the level's $BUILT when saving a changed level.

Fix #106: With mixed dirs and files, picker couldn't scroll to the last file.
Fix #107: Prefer queuing builders to spamming, then you couldn't queue at all.

New user option to unpause on skill assignments.

Tutorial levels are solvable again, and you can't die in them as easily.

0.6.3
-----

2016-06-22

Fix #97: The game advances physics on assignment and unpauses on nuking.

The browsers' breadcrumbs are wider and less tall. I don't display the current
directory in the browser's title bar anymore. The picker shows 20 files
instead of 19, this fixes #96.

The preview draws a dark border around the level instead of the menu color.
Under the preview, I write the level name.

0.6.2
-----

2016-06-20

Multiple hotkeys can be bound to the same function. By default, the editor
moves tiles both with the arrow keys and with ESDF. Pause is bound to [Space]
and to the middle mouse button.

Editor grouping, ungrouping, saving, and save-as can be hotkeyed.

0.6.1
-----

2016-06-18

Editor displays the trigger area of all gadgets.

0.6.0
-----

2016-06-15

Physics: Imploder mask is symmetric. It's wider by 1 lo-res pixel to the right.

You can drag the scrollbar thumb with the left mouse button.

0.5.0
-----

2016-06-14

Physics: Groups with steel have correct distribution of steel, earth, air.

I highlight on the map the lix under the mouse cursor who would get assigned.

The Editor allows to ungroup tiles.

I show hatch spawn direction, describe hovered tiles, and use a more
peaceful color flow for hovers and selections. Save-as forbids special chars.

The game shows the constant spawn interval in the panel. I don't know
whether I want to keep this and make an icon for it, or whether people
don't need it later.

0.4.4
-----

2016-06-06

Bugfixes for these github issues:
#67: Z-ordering several tiles
#85: Hover sorting guarantees group's z-order
#81: Crash on nonexistant base directory of a browser
Button hotkeys are drawn on top of buttons, not behind main text.

I now try to paint the screen black immediately on display creation.
I don't want a white flash before showing the main menu. I have to test at
Icho's Windows machine whether this prevents the white flash.

0.4.3
-----

2016-06-02

Loading levels auto-converts from no-overwrite to tile groups.

Even in a release build, an on-the-fly conversion takes 5.5 seconds for
A Day In Lixtown and 1.2 seconds for Heed the Traffic Light. Lixtown has 2000
pieces and does fancy tricks with no-overwrite. I have to decide whether
the performance is acceptable, whether to improve the algorithm, or whether
to save converted levels to file.

Merged a tree tile by Amanda to prevent getting stuck in its leaves.

Editor remembers the recently-loaded or recently-saved file, similar to how
the game remembers the recently-played level. The singleplayer browser
shows the most recent file.

Don't show elapsed time in singleplayer. It looks like a time limit.
Does anyone want the elapsed time shown nonetheless?

0.4.2
-----

2016-06-01

Level reads and writes tile groups.

The game renders groups with correct air parts inside.
I haven't tested steel, I expect bugs when grouping steel.

There is no conversion yet from no-overwrite to groups.

0.4.1
-----

2016-05-25

Game and editor draw a thin line at the torus seam. This is optional.

The automatic screen start snaps to the level boundary if it's close to it
and the level has no wrapping in that direction.

Started tile grouping using Nepster's algorithm. Thanks for the straightforward
idea in O(n^2), with tips on how to optimize to O(n log n) if wanted!

0.4.0
-----

2016-05-23

Physics change: Climbers couldn't ascend into 1-pixel high gaps with an
overhanging ceiling.

Fix #73: Tile selection boxes were offset. Reason: A5 rotates tiles clockwise.
Many parts of the D Lix source assumed a counter-clockwise rotation.

0.3.7
-----

2016-05-21

The editor's save-as dialog is implemented. It doesn't preview the old level,
but asks before overwriting.

0.3.6
-----

2016-05-18

Editor: new file, quit, and save to existing file are implemented. The editor
asks whether you would like to save when you would lose data on new or quit.

Fixed an editor crash on querying terrain on tiles with negative coordinates.

The editor saves to ./levels/editor-emergency-save.txt when you click save-as,
because save-as is not implemented yet. The editor saves to that file too
on assertion fails, as a safeguard.

0.3.5
-----

2016-05-15

geoo has designed awesome glyphs, representing mouse wheel and buttons.
The infinity symbol is now a big lemniscate. I've included the new glyphs
in the default font. Thank you, geoo!

Editor has a window to set the main level constants, and another to set
the level topology. Non-browser-opening editor buttons have words, not icons.
This addresses issue #74 partially.

The editor can only set the English level title. You can set the intended
number of players per level, but that field has no effect anywhere yet.

0.3.4
-----

2016-05-08

Right mouse button, middle mouse button, wheel up, wheel down are all available
keys to map in the hotkey dialog. There are two keys to map for zoom now.
Default value for zoom-in is wheel-up, default for zoom-out is wheel-down.

Removed the boolean options that became superfluous after allowing mouse
buttons as hotkey bindings. Set the edge scroll speed to 0 to disable it.

Pause accepts two keybindings. I'd like multiple keys for any function.

Singleplayer browser shows author and save requirement, allows to delete level.

Culled variable spawn interval UI and level variables.

Fixed wrong phymap querying: clamping coordinates on a torus must wrap them.

Fixed a crash, the game tried to dispose a null state after long play.

0.3.3
-----

2016-05-03

Fix #42: Zoom increases at level start until at least 70 % of map screen
space is filled. This makes for dynamic zoom per level, per resolution.

Fix #31: I drew air where solid after batch-framestepping, when lots of
drawing and removing happened in short succession. geoo has suggested
the new algorithm that's both simpler and bug-free. Thanks!

0.3.2
-----

2016-05-03

Editor skill window: Clicking the label "Fling-exploder" affects checkbox,
too. Buttons resized and captioned according to Proxima's suggestions.

0.3.1
-----

2016-05-01

File picker scrolls with the mouse wheel.

Replay browser can delete files and lists player names next to files.

The editor keeps the manual or automatic screen start from old levels,
even though it cannot change the screen start yet.

Fix #66: Boolean options react to mouse clicks on their label, not only
to mouse clicks on the checkbox itself.

0.3.0
-----

2016-04-27

Physics change: We don't check for physics near the eye, which would have
depended on the spritesheet. Instead we check at (foot) + (0, y), where
y is 0, -4, -8, and -12. This check is independent from the current lix job.
Rationale: https://www.lemmingsforums.net/index.php?topic=2678

0.2.49
------

2016-04-27

Level and replay browsers select adjacent directories and files by hotkey.

Tile browsers in the editor remember the last-chosen tile's directory,
and use the screen real estate better with 6 x 10 items at a time.

0.2.48
------

Fix: Singleplayer results overwrite outdated level results.

Editor rotates and mirrors terrain pieces, and toggles the dark flag.

When you enter a directory in a browser and the picker highlights the
recent file, this file is scrolled into view.

0.2.47
------

2016-04-20

Fix #65: Sign error when computing the offset for steel checks. The error
shifted steel checks too far into the ground and to the right.

Backwards framestepping is accelerated by 1/lag, where the lag is measured
as ratio (FPS / ideal number of FPS). Slight difference in memory management
for savestates, but no manual management yet.

0.2.46
------

2016-04-20

Fix regression #64: Options menu didn't offer choice of language.

Fix minor bug #62: Profiling via version statements, not empty structs that
would make a call to an allocating string-formatter.

Fixed a crash on opening non-UTF8 files in the Lix file format reader.

Editor allows to clone and z-order-rearrange tiles. There is a bug left behind
when reordering many pieces at once: Sometimes, they reorder among each other
only, producing no change after the entire reordering command.

Sound effects are loaded lazily, that boosts the program start.

0.2.45
------

2016-03-11

Editor UI allows to set the grid by mouse and hotkeys, as in C++/A4 Lix.

Editor moves tiles according to the grid. The clicked-and-dragged tile snaps
to the grid. All other selected tiles move along with it, without snapping to
grid themselves. When moving by keyboard, nothing snaps to grid. The behavior
in this paragraph is identical to C++/A4 Lix.

Editor saves on exiting to ./levels/editor-test.txt.

0.2.44
------

2016-03-30

Browsers offer breadcrumb navigation to pick directories.
We're missing some central features in these browsers now:
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/63

Fixed imports for dmd 2.071.

0.2.43
------

2016-03-26

Editor offers the window to set skills.

The chosen ploder is loaded and offered during play. Levels remember the
chosen ploder, even if 0 ploders are available. The ploder shown on the
panel is the nuke skill.

Bug #4 (game ignores tiles that don't fit into VRAM) doesn't crash anymore,
but ignores the tile instead. The game shows the missing-image error.

0.2.42
------

2016-03-23

Editor adds pieces selected from the tile browser. Editor moves tiles by
keyboard and mouse. No snapping to grid yet.

Fixed #57: The builder gets closer to a vertical wall before stopping.
Fixed #60: The editor selects newly-added tiles immediately.
Fix: Editor-added tiles are clamped to the map, they don't spawn off-bounds.
Fix: The file listing ignores files with pre-extension X, like _order.X.txt.

Rewrote many functions everywhere to take one Point instead of 2 ints.
I have to test for performance regressions.

0.2.41
------

2016-03-18

Singleplayer browser, replay browser, and editor terrain browser all use
the new file picker.

Bugs:
*   Keyboard controls for file up/down are missing. Regression due to rewrite.
*   Scrollbar doesn't react to mouse wheel, or to clicks on the track or car.
*   Replay browser formats the button like the level browser. There is a
    child class for replay button formatting, which I am not using yet.

Misdesign: Picker should control UpOneDirButton. See comment in uponedir.d.

0.2.40
------

2016-03-13

Editor has a terrain browser that can only exit. No browsing for terrain yet.
There's a scrollbar in that terrain browser. The buttons at its end can be
clicked and move the car. The car doesn't do anything when dragged or pulled.

0.2.39
------

Fixed bug #51: Basher always left relics after his first swing.

0.2.38
------

Editor moves tiles by dragging with the mouse. No keyboard movement yet.

0.2.37
------

2016-03-06

Editor can select all tiles.

Editor can add and remove tiles to/from the existing selection.

0.2.36
------

2016-03-05

Fixed the bug described in 0.2.35: Frame-spanning goes across or not across
the torus seam, according to mouse position on the screen. I like the results
in many cases so far. Anything more would require tracking the map scrolling.

Editor has a button for frame-dragging. The button's on-ness and its hotkey
are handled in a nonstandard way, which we want.

Editor has a zoom button toggling between 1x, 2x, 4x zoom, like the game.
We should brainstorm about the zoom UI, and about default zoom.

0.2.35
------

2016-03-05

Editor frame dragging implemented. It selects the correct pieces on a torus.

Bug: It doesn't yet span the frame in the correct direction. Right now,
it always spans so that the torus seam is not included.

0.2.34
------

2016-03-03

Top edge kills unconditionally.

The editor counts and annotates hatches and exits.

0.2.33
------

2016-03-01

I run D's garbage collection whenever there are obsolete game states during
play. Profiling result: My 9-year-old laptop takes 3 ms per collection.
At 16.6 ms per frame, this slows down the back-by-1-second command.
My goal is to attack this bug: https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/38
Let's see whether anybody experiences this bug #38 still, then think again.

0.2.32
------

2016-03-01

Application starts much faster. All bitmap-loading and recoloring is lazy.
Only eye matrix generation is eagerly done at application start.

0.2.31
------

2016-02-28

Implemented editor delete button.

0.2.30

Fix #52: Mose over a transparent terrain tile, gadget behind it:
This selects the gadget now. Before, it selected the terrain tile.

0.2.29
------

2016-02-25

Editor selects pieces on mouse click. No moving yet.

Game starts slightly faster, because I'm not searching through all internal
graphics of all resolutions. Most internal graphics are loaded lazily.
Spritesheet/player-dependent GUI elements are still eagerly loaded, so there
is opportunity for optimization here.

0.2.28
------

2016-02-24

Fix: Replays were saved with a null $BUILT instead of the level's $BUILT.

Editor mouse hovering: Solid pixels are more important than the selection box.
Holding priority invert inverts the entire sequence of terrain and gadgets.

Refactored the code, Filename and Date are immutable by default.

0.2.27
------

2016-02-21

Fix #49: Animate gadgets (most importantly, water and fire) on level start.

0.2.26
------

2016-02-21

Game saves level result on leaving play, or on loading an old state.
Autoreplays are only saved on leaving the game. Should they be saved on
reaching the end-of-game dialog already?

0.2.25
------

2016-02-20

The singleplayer browser shows checkmarks next to solved levels. However,
the game doesn't save any new checkmarks on winning yet.

0.2.24
------

2016-02-17

The editor draws white rectangles around all mouse-hovered terrain pieces.
Refactored TerPos and GadPos to be subclasses of AbstractPos, not structs.

Fix: Editor dark terrain doesn't overwrite gadgets anymore.

0.2.23
------

2016-02-16

Editor renders terrain and gadgets. It uses the same scroll starting position
as the game. I want to reintroduce the manual scroll starting position.

0.2.22
------

2016-02-15

Fixed #44: We sort dirs and levels according to the listing _order.X.txt.

0.2.21
------

2016-02-14

In singleplayer, lix start spawning 1 second after level start, not 4 seconds
after start. The nan-nan sound is played when you start the game, or whenever
you revert to the starting position.

Fixed #48: Assertion failure of climber on torus maps.
Fixed sprite positioning of the climber.

0.2.20
------

2016-02-12

The panel displays elapsed minutes and seconds since level start.

Time limits or overtime haven't been introduced yet. I'm considering to
cull singleplayer time limits from the game altogether.

0.2.19
------

2016-02-11

Fixed an assert fail for new users upon entering the singleplayer browser.

Added a command-line switch to force true fullscreen an arbitrary resolution.
This makes the game run for Ramond. If you have problems getting Lix to run,
try the following, replacing 1600x900 with your possibly different resolution:

    lix --hardfull=1600x900

0.2.18
------

2016-02-10

Sped up turbo-fast-forward: I auto-savestate only every 50 frames instead of
every 10 frames during turbo-fast-forward.

0.2.17
------

2016-02-09

Tiles are loaded differently, depending on whether they're terrain or gadgets.
Terrain tiles are loaded with an extra physics map, and a white copy of
themselves for fast dark-drawing.

I don't think this speeds up the creation of the physics mask, I'm still pretty
slow with that. This vastly speeds up the creation of the level preview image
and the VRAM level bitmap. There is profiling by RAM/VRAM and by drawing mode
of the tiles.

Fixed an assert fail in the file listings used by the browser.

Fixed #40: Misaligned image/physics for dark piece.
I want to ask Clam before I close this issue.

Culled the trampolines.

0.2.16
------

2016-02-06

Started the editor. It displays terrain and can be exited.
There is much to do still with terrain handling, dark, and no-overwrite.

0.2.15
------

2016-02-04

Slightly simplified the keyboard code. I don't believe this fixes Nepster's
stuck keys, but it might be worthwhile to ask Nepster nonetheless about it.

0.2.14
------

2016-02-03

Culled the per-level option to set a custom screen starting position.
The game centers on the average position of all hatches. This accounts
for arbitrary distributions of hatches on tori.

0.2.13
------

2016-02-02

Blocker -> walker: removed 1 frame of the anim, to mimick C++ behavior.
There is an entire unused frame now in the blocker->walker anim now.

Most things -> walker: Added a stand-still walker frame.

Floater y speed should match C++ floater.

0.2.12
------

2016-02-02

Platformer should behave as in C++ Lix now: The first brick is 8 pixels long,
all bricks while kneeling are 6 pixels long.

0.2.11
------

2016-02-01

Fixed left-facing bashers, they now ignore steel in the top 2 hi-res pixels.

Floater assignments don't cancel the builder queue anymore.

0.2.10
------

2016-01-31

Disabled the extra console on Windows by linking with -L/subsystem:windows.

Panel offers imploders.

Listing the included level's name in the replay browser when the pointed-to
level is not there. There's a bug left over for now anyway, see commit message.

0.2.9
-----

2016-01-31

Fixed 3 little bugs: Effects are correctly deleted after framestepping back.
On deleting a replay, the browser highlights the next one correctly again.
The file browser title bar shows the correct subdirectory on browser startup.

0.2.8
-----

2016-01-31

Implement #34: The game mimicks the level tree when saving replays.

0.2.7
-----

2016-01-30

Fix #35: Omitting drawing allowed bypassing traps.

The lix eye coordinate is used to determine where trigger areas affect the
lix. Before this fix, the eye coordinate was only updated on drawing the
lix, becasue the fuse should be positioned there. This allowed to bypass
traps with the head.

Also refactored over 1,000 lines of game code, for a slightly better separation
of physics model and controlling/drawing code.

0.2.6
-----

2016-01-28

Fixed crash during replay verification upon nuking.

0.2.5
-----

2016-01-28

Making shutdown much faster by not freeing any RAM or VRAM.
This is standard for RAM, I have to read up on VRAM practises.

Loading way less internal data for replay verification, speeding up the
startup in that mode massively. We have to decide whether the spritesheet
should affect physics. Right now, existence of frames and eye positions
are meaningful for the physics.

0.2.4
-----

2016-01-27

Noninteractive Replay verification implemented.
Run it from the command line, as in C++ Lix:
bin/lix --verify=replays/solutions
bin/lix --verify=replays/manual/myreplay.txt

Fix: Don't save every possible replay into replays/network/.

Refactoring: Renamed PerformedActivity to Job. Made graphic objects, lixes,
and gadgets take a Topology on construction instead of a Torbit. This makes
the design much more lightweight, we don't even have to generate a Map for the
noninteractive Game.

0.2.3
-----

2016-01-26

Command-line argument `--fullscreen' forces fullscreen, no matter what the
user settings are.

The menu-OK hotkey always performs the most sensible action in the window
during a singleplayer game: resume if it's not at the end, exit if won,
restart if failed.

Editor button in the singleplayer browser, but it doesn't do anything yet.

0.2.2
-----

2016-01-25

Fix #15: Basher always left relics. The basher mask is 2 pixels wider in D
Lix. The relics check accounts for that now.

We wanted to start the basher faster by 2 frames in C++ Lix, to make it
more powerful. Right now, this is implemented in D Lix, because I used as
many recommendations by geoo as I could. In light of the mask that reaches
further by 2 pixels, we should discuss that again. The faster-starting
basher is still OK, probably.

0.2.1
-----

2016-01-25

Implemented ask-for-username menu when no name is given. This prevents having
no name set, and therefore being unable to save options.

Covered the empty space for the spawnint buttons with the info bar for now.

0.2.0
-----

2016-01-24

This is a test release, designed to try singleplayer. Don't replace your
existing installation of Lix with this D/A5 port yet. Keep it separate.

Minim has designed several scaled-up versions of the internal graphics.
They're visible whenever the game's resolution is at least 1.5 times as big
as the old 640x480. Many thanks to Minim for this work!

Levels and terrain graphics have been updated from C++ Lix.

I'm cross-compiling to Windows from Linux now. Let me know of any problems.

0.1.40
------

2016-01-23

Top-left corner of map shows the floating 'R' while replaying. The FPS are
shown on the panel right now, that's intended as a temporary solution only.

Lix target info in the panel shows (RCF) for runners/climbers/floaters, and
displays the number of bricks left for builders and platformers.

Replays cancel on LMB anywhere, and on activating the nuke.

Fix: With lixes returning equal priority, the closest one to the cursor is
preferred for an assignment. Previous bug: the farthest one was preferred.
Inverting priority doesn't invert this check, which is correct.

0.1.39
------

2016-01-22

Fix #32: With mouse speed different from 20, RMB-scrolling continued to
move even after the mouse has stopped moving, as long as RMB was kept down.

0.1.38
------

2016-01-22

The panel info bar uses the correctly recolored garden icons. They have the
correct shadow, according to the user's GUI color settings. (Even though, like
all GUI parts, they aren't recolored until the next program start.)

graphic.gralib has been refactored into a package for better readability.

0.1.37
------

2016-01-21

The replay browser can delete replays. It asks for confirmation with a message
box and moves the highlighting to the next replay.

During the game, the panel's info bar shows colored icons with numbers,
instead of the previously text-only lix counts.

0.1.36
------

2016-01-19

Faster drawing code, by holding bitmaps. Empty skills don't show their hotkey.
Fixed an assert fail on framestepping backwards across Phybit.needCol.

0.1.35
------

2016-01-18

Hatches marked as rotated in the level format spawn lemmings facing left.

0.1.34
------

2016-01-18

Replays are saved automatically on quitting a solved singleplayer level.
This still holds for exiting the game with Shift+Esc immediately.
No replay tree yet; replays are saved as manual/*.txt or solved/*.txt.

0.1.33
------

2016-01-18

Fix #12: Builders, platformers and cubers won't overwrite existing terrain.
Fix #22: Terrain removers don't draw over steel pixels.

Neither fix has affected physics. The remover visuals were particularly
urgent, because they made steel transparent, even though they didn't remove
the steel.

These fixes are implemented with iteration over the lookup map, then issuing
many copies of 1x1 rectangles to the graphics card. This is likely slower
than hardware shaders that examine the existing pixel. It's faster than
making lots of 1x1 sub-bitmaps on the heap, then destroying these again.

(Miner hits steel on my 9.5-year-old laptop: 30 ms for 1x1 sub-bitmaps, 7 ms
for 1x1 rectangles. Miner digging only through non-steel earth is much faster,
about 0.1 ms, and therefore uses the previously existing drawing code.)

The cuber sprite is transparent where it has been drawn to land already.
Now, the player can guess much better when which pixels are added.
I've added a few sparky lines to the cuber's last few frames.

I have removed the tumbler assert. See comment on issue #21:
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/21

0.1.32
------

2016-01-17

Fix #28: Empty skills are now re-selected if replenished after state loading.
Fix #29: Drawing explosions properly now.

I haven't tested implosions. They should be drawn behind the terrain anyway,
or get a completely new animation.

0.1.31
------

2016-01-16

Basher ignores top two rows of his 18 rows for steel.

Partial fix of #22: basher/miner cancels on hitting steel, but still takes
out some of the graphics. Physics are correct.

After class Game finishes, the correct browser is loaded, either singleplayer
or replay. Browsers exit on RMB. No option to auto-save singleplayer replays
that fail the level.

0.1.30
------

2016-01-15

Replay browser implemented. Loads replays, renders the correct level in the
preview. Program main loop calls game with the correct level and replay file,
the game plays back the correct replay. After viewing the replay, the program
goes back to the singleplayer browser, not to the replay browser.

Framestepping backwards is more performant over long distances, it omits
unnecessary intermediate savestates that would be discarded anyway. More ideas:
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/26

Slightly better text shadow positioning. Removed demo and benchmark code.

0.1.29
------

2016-01-12

Level preview renders and scales the level correctly, instead of displaying
only a colorful rectangle.

User savestating is implemented including saving/loading, but it doesn't
preserve effects, see issue #23.

Fixed bug #13: Framestepping buttons execute continuously on holding RMB.

0.1.28
------

Implemented the nuke.

Implemented replay arrows upon skill assignments, which are correctly
played back during framestepping and after restarting the level.

Explosions, flying pixels, and flying terrain remover equipment isn't in yet.

0.1.27
------

Miner implemented with geoo's anti-shock C++ code.

Flingers and trampolines are implemented.

0.1.26
------

2016-01-04

Singleplayer browser remembers the most recently played level.

Fixed bug #18: Assigning runner to a walker didn't make her run immediately.
Fixed bug #20: Assigning exploder to builder crashed the game due to
inability to return skills.

Fixed climber horizontal alignment with the wall, the alignment was set
correctly previously, but never reset correctly.

Exploder with flinging is now implemented similar to how it was in C++.
It should be checked for accuracy, once loading replays from disk is
implemented.

Fixed a crash on becoming tumbler. There is still an elusive assert fail
triggerable in the tumbler function. That should be debugged once replays
can be loaded from disk.

0.1.25
------

2016-01-03

Fixed bug #19: Tumbler selected only frames 2 or 3. Now, it selects its frame
by angle of flight now, while not advancing too far in any single frame.
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/19

0.1.24
------

2016-01-02

Fixed bug #10: Map drawing: Target area too large.
https://github.com/SimonN/LixD/issues/10

0.1.23
------

2016-01-01

Options menu complete. Some options don't do anything yet, but are loaded/saved
correctly nonetheless. Removed fullscreen resolution option. Switching users
works. Switching Language works.

I found the first bug of 2016 in the D compiler. ^_^

0.1.22
------

2015-12-31

Implemented GUI elements: Text entry, number picker, hotkey picker.
In the options menu, implemented 2/3 hotkey pages, and the graphics page.
Each hotkeyed button displays its hotkey in the bottom-right-hand corner.

Added 0.5f to the djvuM offset (the main font's vertical position), now
it looks great on 640x480, 800x600, 1280x1024, and 1400x1050.

0.1.21
------

2015-12-29

Implemented goals (exits), triggered traps, and dying outside of the level.
Implemented the Esc-during-level menu and the end-of-level menu. No browser
to save/view replays yet. Begun implementing the options menu.

0.1.17
------

2015-12-17

Bugfix: Blockers are now released upon walker assignment.

0.1.16
------

2015-12-16

All skills are implemented fully or mostly each, except for the miner,
which is missing completely still. Effects, like arrows, flying dig hammers,
and explosions, are missing.

Skills behave mostly identical to C++ Lix. Some extremely arcane behavioral
bugs were fixed while porting; report if things behave obviously strangely.
Probably also report if things behave differently.

Known differences: Exploder crater is 1 pixel smaller, diameter of 46 pixels
instead of 47 pixels, but should be completely symmetrical now. Blocker
doesn't get released on walker assignment; this fixed only in 0.1.17.

0.1.12
------

2015-11-30

Implemented builder and digger. The builder still draws on top of existing
land, which is merely a visual bug, not a physics bug. The digger makes
steel transparent, but the steel and terrain data inside the steel remains
present for physics; again only a visual bug.

0.1.5
-----

2015-11-19

Map detects mouse on the land properly, at least with zoom == 1. Priority
computation has been ported over. You can click lix and hear the assign
sound being played if the assignment were legal. Assignments aren't in yet.

0.1.4
-----

2015-11-15

Walker, Faller and Ascender are implemented and should perform like their
C++ versions. I would like to keep close to the C++ behavior for now.
Savestates have been implemented for framestepping. Skill assignments
are not possible yet.

0.1.2
-----

2015-10-30

Started implementing Lix skills. There will likely be no problem with them
scanning the terrain from the lookupmap. I'm anxious about them writing to
the terrain later on, when the more interesting skills get added.

0.1.0
-----

2015-08-24

First Windows build released on Lemmings Forums as a smoke test. It runs
well for most people. Drawing has bad performance still with about 3,500
animated gadgets, but is much better with about 200 than in the previous
months.

0.0.0
-----

2015-02-28

Started development by porting the fundamental Lix graphic classes from
Allegro 4.4 to Allegro 5 with the D Programming Language.

C++ Lix
-------

2006 to 2016

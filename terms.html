<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<p><em>Last updated: February 16, 2021</em></p>

<p>Opera Norway AS and its affiliates offer a number of different services through their respective websites and software. The terms of this document govern your use of those services. Please read this document carefully.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p><strong>This is a contract.</strong></p>

        <p>a. These Terms of Service (“Terms”), along with Opera’s Privacy Statement, form a legally-binding contract between you and Opera Norway AS (P.O. Box 4214, Nydalen, 0401, Oslo, Norway), as well as its affiliates (“Opera” and “we,” “us” and “our”). By using the Services (as defined below), you are agreeing to be legally bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree with these Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.</p>

        <p>b. As used in these Terms, the word “Services” applies to online services provided to you by Opera through its software applications, websites and APIs.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>We expect you to be a responsible user.</strong></p>

        <p>a. You agree that you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. You agree to follow all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations. You are solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur while using any Services, including the content of any transmissions you send through the Services and any content you upload or publish using the Services.</p>

        <p>b. We expect you to respect the rights of others. By using the Services, you agree that you will not upload, transfer, or otherwise make available files, images, code, materials, or other information or content (“Content”) that violates the rights of any third party, including their intellectual property rights, however defined.</p>

        <p>c. You also agree not to upload, transfer, or otherwise make available any Content that is obscene, vulgar, sexually-oriented, hateful, or threatening. Opera strictly forbids unsolicited messaging and unauthorized advertisements while using the Services.</p>

        <p>d. Opera has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse content and will terminate the access of any user who publishes or distributes child sexual abuse content. Furthermore, we will report such users to the appropriate authorities.</p>

        <p>e. You are responsible for the security of your user account. Certain Services (including use of Opera’s forums) allow you to create a user account to access certain Services. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user account and password. Additionally, you are also responsible for any and all activities that occur under your user account.</p>

        <p>f. You acknowledge that information of any kind presented to you via the Services may be protected by copyright, trademark, patent and/or other proprietary rights and laws. You agree not to violate these laws or infringe these rights in any way.</p>

        <p>g. Certain features of the Services may allow you to publish or send content that can be viewed by others (“User Generated Content”). You agree that Opera is not liable for User Generated Content that is provided by others. Opera has no duty to pre-screen User Generated Content, but Opera has the right to refuse to post, edit, or deliver User Generated Content. Opera reserves the right to remove User Generated Content for any reason, but Opera is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material. Opera reserves the right to block any user’s access to any content, website or web page at our sole discretion.</p>

        <p>h. Opera does not claim ownership of any User Generated Content. However, by submitting User Generated Content on any Service, including any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques described therein, you consent to Opera’s unrestricted use of those items.</p>

        <p>i. If you upload any Content or User Generated Content to Opera’s sites, you warrant that you have the necessary rights and authority to do so, including the necessary consent to upload and distribute any personal information about third persons. You agree that you will not upload viruses or other forms of malware.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Details.</strong> For clarity, and consistent with the rest of these Terms, here are further details on specific Services that may be available through the Opera websites or software applications.</p>

        <p>a. Extension catalog: Opera may offer a portfolio of third party browser extensions and themes (“Add-Ons”). Opera exercises no editorial control over the Add-Ons that you access through this Service.</p>

        <p>b. Compression: Opera’s software applications include compression functionality to enable users to boost the download of web content such as web pages and/or videos. This functionality requests web content through Opera’s proxy or compression servers. Your browsing experience may change due to increased loading speeds. Certain web pages may not be available through proxy servers.</p>

        <p>c. News recommendations: Opera’s software applications may include a current news feed feature to help you discover and access news content made available by third parties on the internet. Opera exercises no editorial control over any content that you access through this Service.</p>

        <p>d. Synchronization: Opera allows you to enable synchronization of browser data such as your speed dials between Opera browsers on the devices you are using. This Service requires that you login to a social network service or create an Opera account.</p>

        <p>e. Contextual hints: Opera’s browser for computers may include “Browser Assistant”, a component that provides contextual hints about certain Opera browser features and other useful information which you might be interested in. Browser Assistant is an optional component of the software.</p>

        <p>f. Virtual Private Network: Through Opera’s browser you may have access to a virtual private network (“VPN”). Consistent with other provisions of these Terms, you agree not to use the VPN service in a manner that violates applicable law or otherwise infringes any third party’s rights. Opera does not guarantee that VPN service will always be available. The VPN feature is not an end-to-end service and it does not guarantee that any transmissions of information made while using VPN will be secure. Note that certain websites may not be accessible while using VPN.</p>

        <p>g. Snapshot: Opera’s browser for computers may include functions that enable you to easily take screenshots of content viewed through the browser. This feature is for your personal, non-commercial use only. You agree never to use the feature in any way that violates applicable law, or the rights of any third party, including copyrights.</p>
    </li>

        <p><strong>User Generated Content.</strong> Gamebox provides interfaces and tools for Users to generate content and make it available to other users, including ratings, reviews, profile images, banners, and others (“User Generated Content” or “UGC”). By uploading or creating such UGC, you grant Opera the worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty free license to use, reproduce, create derivative works, display, perform and distribute for the UGC.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Publisher content.</strong> Publishers are solely responsible for the content they upload and distribute on Gamebox. Publishers affirm, represent, and warrant that they own or have the rights, licenses, permissions and consents necessary to publish, duplicate, and distribute the submitted content. By submitting content to the Service for distribution, Publishers also grant a license to Opera for all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to the Content for publication on the Service, pursuant to these Terms. Opera does not endorse copyright infringing activities or other intellectual property infringing activities and violations of the law may result in the removal of content if Opera is notified of such violations. Removal and termination of accounts may occur without prior notice.</p>

        <p>Publishers retain all ownership rights to the submitted content, and by submitting content to the Service, Publishers hereby grant the following:</p>

        <p>a. To Opera, a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the content in connection with the Service, including without limitation for promoting, redistributing in any and all media formats. If you choose to remove your content from the Service, this license shall terminate within a commercially reasonable time after you remove your content from the Service.</p>

        <p>b. To Users, a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access the content and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such content as permitted through the functionality of the Service. Users shall retain a license to this content even after the content is removed from the Service.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Payment forms.</strong> Publishers who distribute content on the Service for a fee may be subject to the acceptable use policies of our payment providers. You can review the acceptable use policies for our payment providers:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/ua/legalhub-full">PayPal</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://stripe.com/legal">Stripe</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>When you provide payment information to Opera or one of its payment providers, you represent that you are the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment, and you authorize Opera to charge your credit card or process your payment with the chosen payment provider.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Transactions and Fees.</strong> Publishers may set the prices, at their own discretion, for their content and products to be sold through the Service (each sale, a “Transaction”). Opera shall be entitled to a share of the revenue Publishers receive from Transactions which shall be calculated on the gross revenue from the Transactions, not including any Transactions for which Publisher or Opera provides a refund in accordance with the transaction configuration on Publisher’s account (the “Revenue Share”). For Transactions, Opera will collect the purchase price and any applicable fees and taxes through its payment providers, and will pay to Publisher the proceeds net of the applicable Revenue Share, payment provider fees, and applicable taxes, VAT, duties, charges or levies. Opera may withhold any taxes, duties, charges or levies on payments by Opera to Publisher pursuant to these Terms, as may be required by applicable law, rule or regulation, and submit such withheld taxes, duties, charges or levies to the appropriate tax authority. Use of IP proxies or other methods to disguise your place of residence, whether to circumvent geographic restrictions on content, to purchase at a price not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose, is a violation of these Terms.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Refunds.</strong> Users may request, and Opera may process, refund requests if the purchased content cannot run, some other issue prevents access to the content, or the product does not accurately represent what was advertised. For technical issues, Opera will direct users to the Publisher to first try to resolve such issues. To request a refund, please contact support with your purchase information. For content selling third party external keys (e.g. Steam keys), Opera may require the Publisher to confirm cancellation of the key before a refund can be processed due to Opera’s inability to disable access. Some Publishers utilizing older payment methods are responsible for handling refunds themselves. If you are uncertain about refund eligibility, please contact support.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Start of the Terms.</strong> These Terms start when you confirm your agreement to it or start using any of the Gamebox Property and will end once either you or we terminate it, as we explain below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Your Termination Rights.</strong> You may terminate the contract offered by these Terms at any time by ceasing all use of the Gamebox Property at any time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Our Termination Rights.</strong> We may restrict, suspend or terminate the contract offered by these Terms and your access to all or any part of the Gamebox Property and/or Publisher Property at any time without prior notice or liability if:</p>

        <p>a. you commit a breach of your obligations or any other term under these Terms or violate the rights of any third party intellectual property owner;</p>

        <p>b. if you are an individual, you become bankrupt;</p>

        <p>c. if you are another legal entity, you become insolvent (including being unable to pay your debts as they fall due and/or the value of your assets is less than the amount of your liabilities, taking into account contingent and prospective liabilities), propose an individual, company or partnership voluntary arrangement, have a receiver, administrator or manager or trustee in bankruptcy appointed over the whole or any part of your business or assets; if any petition shall be presented in good faith, order shall be made or resolution passed for your winding up (except for the purpose of amalgamation or reconstruction), bankruptcy or dissolution (including the appointment of provisional liquidators/interim receivers or special managers); if you shall otherwise propose or enter into any composition or arrangement with your creditors or any class of them or you cease or threaten to cease to carry on business;</p>

        <p>d. we decide not to provide the Gamebox Property anymore (see below);</p>

        <p>e. you act in any way that may be considered threatening, abusive, obscene, racist, xenophobic, sexist, defamatory, or otherwise offensive or illegal towards any member of Opera staff;</p>

        <p>f. we delete your Gamebox account in response to a data deletion request from you;</p>

        <p>g. we delete your Gamebox account due to sustained periods of inactivity, provided that we will use reasonable efforts to contact you via the contact details you have provided to us prior to terminating your Gamebox account under this ground.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Effect of Termination.</strong> If your contract with us offered by these Terms discontinues for any reason then it will cease immediately to have effect (apart from any sections that are necessary for our enforcement of any legal rights and remedies against you). This means that you will no longer have access to the Gamebox Property and Publisher Property.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> Neither party shall be liable for any failure to fulfil its obligations under these Terms as a result of force majeure and in such circumstances the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed or failed to be performed. If either party is prevented or delayed in the performance of its obligations under these Terms by reason of force majeure, that party shall, as soon as reasonably possible, serve notice in writing on the other party specifying the nature and extent of the circumstances giving rise to force majeure. In this section 12 (Force Majeure), “Force Majeure” means any cause preventing a party from performing any or all of its obligations that arises from or is attributable to acts, events, omissions or accidents beyond the reasonable control of the party so prevented including strikes, lock-outs or other industrial disputes (other than any such dispute involving the workforce of the party so prevented), nuclear accident or acts of God, war or terrorist activity, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage (excluding malicious damage involving the employees of the affected party or its subcontractors), industrial action by employees of any providers of electrical power, failure of technical facilities, fire, flood, or storm or default of suppliers or subcontractors.</p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Ceasing to provide the Gamebox Property or Publisher Property.</strong> If we decide to cease to provide the Gamebox Property, then you will be notified as soon as reasonably possible. If for any reason Publisher Property that you have validly licensed is taken down from the Gamebox Platforms, we encourage Publishers to notify you and ensure that the relevant Publisher Property will remain available to valid existing Users for a period of 30 days (but subject to our ultimate discretion and legal obligations as to whether they can be made available in this way or not). Following that period, the Publisher Property (and/or if appropriate the relevant Gamebox Property) will no longer be available unless we notify you otherwise.</li>

<h2 id="loomi">Loomi by Opera</h2>

<p><em>Last updated: October 13, 2021</em></p>

<p>The Loomi by Opera service (“Service”) is a video on demand Service offered by Opera Norway AS (“Opera”). These Service Specific Terms, together with the general Terms of Service (collectively, the “Terms”), govern your use of the Service. Please read the Terms carefully.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may be able to access the Loomi by Opera Service to view movies, TV, videos, and other media (“Programs”) via an in-app service or through the <a href="https://loomi.tv">Loomi website</a>. The following terms apply to your use of the Loomi Service and the Loomi Programs.</p>

        <p>a. Through Loomi you may stream Programs that are available for free. Free Programs are supported by third party advertising. Opera is not responsible for the advertising content of third parties which you may see via the Service.</p>

        <p>b. Some Programs are available for rent, meaning that in exchange for a fee (the “Rental Fee”) you will be granted access to stream your selected Programs through Loomi for a limited time as described below.</p>

        <p>c. Loomi is not available in all territories, and the selection of Programs available via Loomi may vary from place to place. You are allowed to view only those items of Programs which have been specifically licensed for the country where you are registered (the “Territory”). Loomi is only for users 18 years of age or older.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Rentals</strong></p>

        <p>a. When you rent a Program,you have 30 days from the date of payment to view the Program. If you choose not to start viewing the Program within 30 days, your ability to access it will expire unless you pay another Rental Fee.</p>

        <p>b. You are granted access to a Program for a period of 48 hours, starting from when you first access the Program. After 48 hours have passed, you will not be permitted access to the Program unless you pay another Rental Fee.</p>

        <p>c. You can view rented Programs on up to three devices per account, and you may stream a maximum of two Programs simultaneously.</p>

        <p>d. Payments for Rentals are handled by third-party payment service providers, including PayU. Your payments are subject to PayU’s terms and conditions. You may not access a rental Program until your payment has been validated.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>Responsibility for Programs</strong></p>

        <p>a. Opera licenses all Programs from third parties, including movie studios, creators, influencers, bloggers, and other rightsholders. All Programs, including all intellectual property rights and other interest embodied therein, are the exclusive property of the respective rightsholders. In other words Opera does not own and is not responsible for Programs you can view on Loomi.</p>

        <p>b. All Programs on the Loomi Service are available on a limited basis and are strictly for personal use. You are allowed only to view Programs in the Territory and solely in compliance with these Terms. You may not download, copy, broadcast, or use Programs in any way except as expressly provided in these Terms. You may not exhibit or display Programs in public spaces of any kind or charge admission to view them. Additional or different restrictions may apply on a case-by-case basis.</p>

        <p>c. Your ability to access Programs may be restricted by Territory. You may not use VPN or any other means to improperly access Programs from outside the applicable Territory. Any attempt to circumvent technical measures to ensure compliance with these Terms is a violation of these Terms and may result in your ability to access Loomi or the Programs being terminated without penalty.</p>

        <p>d. If you are a rightsholder who believes that your Programs are improperly appearing in the Loomi Service, contact <a href="mailto:support@loomi.tv">support@loomi.tv</a>, stating the specific title of the work at issue, the context in which it appeared (including a link), and your complete legal name and contact information (or that of the author).

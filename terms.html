    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated:&nbsp;December 14, 2018</p>
    <p>Opera Software AS and its affiliates offer a number of different services through their
        respective websites and software. The terms of this document govern your use of those services. Please read this
        document carefully.</p><p><b>1. This is a contract.</b></p>
    <p>a. These Terms of Service (“Terms”), along with Opera’s Privacy Statement, form a
        legally-binding contract between you and Opera Software AS, a Norwegian company whose principal place of
        business is Gjerdrumsvei 19, 0484, Oslo, Norway, as well as its affiliates (“Opera” and “we,” “us” and “our”).
        By using the Services (as defined below), you are agreeing to be legally bound by these Terms. If you don’t
        agree with these Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.</p>
    <p>b. As used in these Terms, the word “Services” applies to online services provided to you by
        Opera through its software applications, websites and APIs.</p>
    <p><b>2. We expect you to be a responsible user.</b></p>
    <p>a. You agree that you will not use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or
        prohibited by these Terms. You agree to follow all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and
        regulations. You are solely responsible for all acts or omissions that occur while using any Services, including
        the content of any transmissions you send through the Services and any content you upload or publish using the
        Services.</p>
    <p>b. We expect you to respect the rights of others. By using the Services, you agree that you
        will not upload, transfer, or otherwise make available files, images, code, materials, or other information or
        content (“Content”) that violates the rights of any third party, including their intellectual property rights,
        however defined.</p>
    <p>c. You also agree not to upload, transfer, or otherwise make available any Content that is
        obscene, vulgar, sexually-oriented, hateful, or threatening. Opera strictly forbids unsolicited messaging and
        unauthorized advertisements while using the Services.</p>
    <p>d. Opera has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse content and will terminate
        the access of any user who publishes or distributes child sexual abuse content. Furthermore, we will report such
        user to the appropriate authorities.</p>
    <p>e. You are responsible for the security of your user account. Certain Services (including
        use of Opera’s forums) allow you to create a user account to access to certain Services. You are entirely
        responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user account and password. Additionally, you are also
        responsible for any and all activities that occur under your user account.</p>
    <p>f. You acknowledge that information of any kind presented to you via the Services may be
        protected by copyright, trademark, patent and/or other proprietary rights and laws. You agree not to violate
        these laws or infringe these rights in any way.</p>
    <p>g. Certain features of the Services may allow you to publish or send content that can be
        viewed by others (“User Generated Content”). You agree that Opera is not liable for User Generated Content that
        is provided by others. Opera has no duty to pre-screen User Generated Content, but Opera has the right to refuse
        to post, edit, or deliver User Generated Content. Opera reserves the right to remove User Generated Content for
        any reason, but Opera is not responsible for any failure or delay in removing such material. Opera reserves the
        right to block any user’s access to any content, website or webpage at our sole discretion.</p>
    <p>h. Opera does not claim ownership of any User Generated Content. However, by submitting User
        Generated Content on any Service, including any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques described therein, you
        consent to Opera’s unrestricted use of those items.</p>
    <p>i. If you upload any Content or User Generated Content to Opera’s sites, you warrant that
        you have the necessary rights and authority to do so, including the necessary consent to upload and distribute
        any personal information about third persons. You agree that you will not upload viruses or other forms of
        malware.</p>
    <p><b>3. Details.</b>&nbsp;For clarity, and consistent with the rest of these Terms, here are
        further details on specific Services that may be available through the Opera websites or software applications.
    </p><p>a. Extension catalog: Opera may offer a portfolio of third party browser extensions and
    themes (“Add-Ons”). Opera exercises no editorial control over the Add-Ons that you access through this Service.</p>
    <p>b. Compression: Opera’s software applications include compression functionality to enable
        users to boost the download of web content such as webpages and/or videos. This functionality requests web
        content through Opera’s proxy or compression servers. Your browsing experience may change due to increased
        loading speeds. Certain webpages may not be available through proxy servers.</p>
    <p>c. News recommendations: Opera’s software applications may include a current news feed
        feature to help you discover and access news content made available by third parties on the internet. Opera
        exercises no editorial control over any content that you access through this Service.</p>
    <p>d. Synchronization: Opera allows you to enable synchronization of browser data such as your
        speed dials between Opera browsers on the devices you are using. This Service requires that you login to a
        social network service or create an Opera account.</p>
    <p>e. Contextual hints: Opera’s browser for computers may include “Browser Assistant”, a
        component that provides contextual hints about certain Opera browser features and other useful information which
        you might be interested in. Browser Assistant is an optional component of the software.</p>

    </p><p>ADDITIONAL CRYPTO WALLET TERMS</p>
    <p>Opera’s crypto wallet Service provides self-hosted, user controlled services related to
        Ethereum and related cryptographically secured tokens (“Crypto Currency”). While commonly referred to as a
        “wallet”, it is important for you to understand that, unlike cash in a physical wallet, Crypto Currency is not
        stored in the wallet.</p>
    <p>Our wallet Service stores a key pair (an address or public key, as well as an encrypted
        private key). The key pair enables you to communicate with Ethereum-based blockchains (“Ethereum Networks”)
        through our wallet Service and without requiring you to download or install additional software to your device.
        Any Crypto Currency, however, is stored, sent and received by and within the relevant Ethereum Network. The
        wallet Service facilitates your communications with and use of these Ethereum Networks.</p>
    <p>Ethereum Networks are peer-to-peer networks supported by third parties. In order to be
        completed, all proposed transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Crypto Currency’s associated network.
        We have no control over the Ethereum Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction
        details that you submit will be confirmed and processed, or that this will occur in a timely manner. You should
        carefully asses the Ethereum Network and Crypto Currency with which you choose to transact. Use of our wallet
        Service is subject to these Terms of Service, including the following:</p>
    <p><b>a. Create or Import a Wallet.</b>&nbsp;To use this Service, you must either import an
        existing wallet or create a new wallet. If you create a new wallet, you will be assigned a key pair consisting
        of a public key (or address) for your wallet, as well as an encrypted private key. You will also be assigned a
        human readable, mnemonic pass phrase (“Backup Phrase”) for use in accessing your encrypted private key.</p>
    <p><b>b. Write Down Your Backup Phrase.</b>&nbsp;When creating a new wallet, you will be
        prompted to write down your Backup Phrase. Your wallet does not receive or store your Backup Phrase. Neither
        your key pair nor the Backup Phrase is available to us. We cannot, therefore, assist you with key pair or Backup
        Phrase retrieval. We cannot generate a new Backup Phrase for your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that any
        Crypto Currency you have associated with your wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your
        Backup Phrase. We also strongly encourage users to take a backup of their Backup Phrase as well as their key
        pair on an external medium.</p>
    <p><b>c. Keep Your Backup Phrase Secure.</b>&nbsp;The Backup Phrase can be used to unlock your
        encrypted private key, which is stored in a separate file on your device. The private key is connected to your
        wallet’s public address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Crypto Currency to and from
        that address. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Backup Phrase, and will be
        fully responsible for any and all activities that occur using such Backup Phrase.</p>
    <p><b>d. You are Responsible to Manage Your Crypto Currency.</b>&nbsp;Once transaction details
        have been submitted to an Ethereum Network it is not possible to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. We
        have no control over any Ethereum Network and we do not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or
        modification request. You must ensure that you have adequate Crypto Currency associated with your wallet address
        before initiating a transaction.</p>
    <p><b>e. You Must Comply With the Law.</b>&nbsp;You can only use our wallet Service if
        permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction. Please make sure that your use of the wallet Service are in
        compliance with all laws, rules, and regulations that apply to you. It is your responsibility to determine what,
        if any, taxes apply to your Crypto Currency transactions, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the
        correct tax to the appropriate tax authority where applicable. We are not responsible for determining whether
        taxes apply to your transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from
        any of your transactions.</p>

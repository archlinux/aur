### Bug Fixes

    To make use of this feature, users will need to add the following to their [settings.json] file to include the following:
    ```json
    "additionalProducts": [{
        "filter": "edh4",
        "directory": "elite-dangerous-odyssey-64",
        "serverargs": "",
        "gameargs": "SeasonTwo",
        "sortkey": "04",
        "product_name": "Elite Dangerous: Horizons (4.0)",
        "product_sku": "FORC-FDEV-DO-38-IN-40"
    }]
    ```

### Enhancements
- Support `.rdr` files when looking for a product's directory
- Show progress indicator when verifying integrity of game files

### Bug Fixes

## [0.6.0] - 2022-09-15

### New Features
- Read arguments from STDIN which allows for piping info from other apps (e.g. legendary)

### Enhancements
- Added support for detecting wine usage from command line args
- Better logging for when failing to get an Epic auth token
- Upgrade to .Net 6
- Add Horizons 4.0 launch flag to default settings (`/edh4`)

  Users upgrading from previous versions will need to manually [update](https://github.com/rfvgyhn/min-ed-launcher/commit/c1b64c4a834dcf59fe90ff7b22e88ce6aeffd7bc#diff-c816007aa9ea03a01c4190efee0827d0ac32ff978fe02981844c1b5213d55e49) their [settings.json] or delete it and let it be autogenerated to include the new flag
### Misc
- Log file is placed in a standard location (`%LOCALAPPDATA%`, `$XDG_STATE_HOME`).

Epic users on Linux should now have an easier time launching the game by utilizing [legendary]
to automatically generate an exchange code instead of having to manually copy it from your browser.

Example usage:
```
legendary launch --dry-run 9c203b6ed35846e8a4a9ff1e314f6593 2> >(grep "Launch parameters") | cut -d':' -f 3- | WINEPREFIX=/your/wine/prefix /path/to/MinEdLauncher /autorun /edh /autoquit
```

## [0.5.4] - 2021-10-19

### Bug Fixes
- Add `User-Agent` http header when requesting an Epic auth token

## [0.5.3] - 2021-06-09

### Bug Fixes
- Implement _working_ temporary workaround for launcher failing when Steam starts the executable via `reaper`
- Fix EDLaunch.exe path being treated as product whitelist item

## [0.5.2] - 2021-06-09

### Security
- Address [CVE-2021-31957] by building with latest version of .net SDK (5.0.301)

### Bug Fixes

## [0.5.1] - 2021-06-04

### Enhancements

- Automatically fix Odyssey filter by providing correct override in default `settings.json`

  Users upgrading from previous versions will need to manually update their `settings.json` file or delete it and let it be auto-created again.
  
  Manual update should include the following:
  ```json
  "filterOverrides": [
        { "sku": "FORC-FDEV-DO-1000", "filter": "edo" }
    ]
  ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fix filter overrides not being case-insensitive
- Fix `/novr` flag being treated as a product whitelist

## [0.5.0] - 2021-06-03

### Breaking Changes
- Restart option has moved to the `/restart delay` argument and is no longer specified in the config file.
  
  This allows for creating separate shortcuts, one for normal gameplay and one for restarting.
  
  Instead of specifying `restart: { enabled: true, shutdownTimeout: 3 }`, modify your launch options to include `/restart 3`.

### New Features
- Add ability to override a product's filter via the config file
  
  Useful for when FDev makes a copy/paste error for a new product (i.e. when they released Odyssey with an "edh" filter instead of "edo")

## [0.4.0] - 2021-05-11

### New Features
- Add support for Frontier accounts via the `/frontier` argument. This includes logging in with a single game installation (e.g. Steam) and
  keeping the game up-to-date if you don't use Steam or Epic. See the readme for instructions on how to use this feature.
  
### Security
- Address [CVE-2021-31204] by building with latest version of .net (5.0.6)

## [0.3.1] - 2021-03-31

### New Features
- Add ability to select product to run

### Enhancements
- Add workaround for Steam always setting `$LC_ALL` to `C` which prevented the correct game language from being selected
- Include launcher's directory as potential Elite Dangerous install location

### Bug Fixes
- Properly parse proton when it's in `compatibilitytools.d` dir. Custom versions of proton, such as [Proton-GE], are stored here.
- Fix `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR` not always being parsed properly
- Fix not being able to handle a variable amount of steam linux runtime args (i.e. `--deploy=soldier --suite=soldier --verb=waitforexitandrun` vs `--verb=waitforexitandrun`)

## [0.3.0] - 2020-12-28

### New Features

- Add support for specifying Elite's language instead of just using the system default

## [0.2.0] - 2020-12-13

Subject: [PATCH 05/36] x86/sgx: Ensure no data in PCMD page after truncate

A PCMD (Paging Crypto MetaData) page contains the PCMD
structures of enclave pages that have been encrypted and
moved to the shmem backing store. When all enclave pages
sharing a PCMD page are loaded in the enclave, there is no
need for the PCMD page and it can be truncated from the
backing store.

A few issues appeared around the truncation of PCMD pages. The
known issues have been addressed but the PCMD handling code could
be made more robust by loudly complaining if any new issue appears
in this area.

Add a check that will complain with a warning if the PCMD page is not
actually empty after it has been truncated. There should never be data
in the PCMD page at this point since it is was just checked to be empty
and truncated with enclave mutex held and is updated with the
enclave mutex held.

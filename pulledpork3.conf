# you can do this by giving an explict snort_version or by providing the path (snort_path)
# to the snort binary.  If you don't do either of these, PulledPork will try to determine
# the version of snort by searching for the the binary on your system path.
# This is used to know which registere ruleset to download, the correct files from the LightSPD
# ruleset, and will be used to compile .so rules if you don't provide the distro.

# WARNING: RULE MODIFICATION WITH THESE FILES IS PARTIALLY IMPMEMENTED
#   The code for this functionality is experimental, and does not handle GID:SID Ranges

#   you can use PulledPork2 compatable files / formatting for these files 
#
# Here you can specify what rule modification files to run automatically.
# simply uncomment and specify the apt path.

# WARNING: RULE MODIFICATION with modifysid IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
# modifysid=/etc/pulledpork/modifysid.conf

# WARNING: RULE MODIFICATION IS NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
# The following option, state_order, allows you to more finely control the order
# that pulledpork performs the modify operations, specifically the enablesid
# disablesid and dropsid functions.  An example use case here would be to
# disable an entire category and later enable only a rule or two out of it.
# the valid values are disable, drop, and enable.
# state_order=disable,drop,enable

# PulledPork will use the system default temporary working directory, unless you specify a different one below.
# (this is not common).  PulledPork will create a working folder named PulledPork-YYYY.MM.DD-HH.MM.SS in the
# temp location. This is useful during troubleshooting PulledPork3 with the -k (keep temp directory) flag
#temp_path = /tmp

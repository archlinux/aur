       hereunder, except as permitted under Section 3.2.
       (B) Deployment: You may use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, and Deploy Covered Code, provided that

2.7 Derivative Works. If You create or use a modified version of this License (which You may only do in order to apply it to
code that is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename the license and (b) otherwise make it
clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from this License.

3      OBLIGATIONS REGARDING DISTRIBUTION.
3.1 Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
Section 2.1 above have been met; in addition You must conspicuously set forth, in documentation or collateral in which You
describe recipients' rights in any Executable version, a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Original Code is
available under the terms of this License.
3.2 Your Distribution License. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability
obligations and other rights consistent with the scope of this License (“Additional Terms”) to recipients of Covered Code,
provided, however, that: (a) You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of GIPS;
(b) You must make it absolutely clear that Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and not by GIPS; and (c) the license may
not limit or alter the recipient's rights in Original Code version from the rights set forth in this License. You hereby agree to
defend and indemnify GIPS regarding any claims asserted against GIPS relating to any Additional Terms.

4      NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.
COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE “AS IS” AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES THAT COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT GIPS) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE; NO USE OF ANY
COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
The Covered Code may be incomplete; contain pre-release, untested, or not-fully-tested works; and may contain errors that could
cause failures or loss of data. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of any Covered Code is at Your sole and entire risk.
No upgrades or support are provided under this License.

5      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT IS GIPS OR ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY,
WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, PRODUCTS LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR
THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF GIPS HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT DOES GIPS'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY
BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) UNDER THIS LICENSE EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY US DOLLARS (US$50.00).


6      TRADEMARKS.
This License does not grant any right or license to use the trademarks or trade names “Global IP Solutions”, “GIPS”, “iLBC”,
“MediaWare”, “GIPS VoiceEngine, GIPS VideoEngine NetEQ, iSAC, iPCM-wb, GIPS Enhanced G.711, Remote Extension,
Click-to-Talk or any other GIPS trademarks, trade names, design marks, or logos (collectively, “GIPS Marks”), except that

from the Original Code other than as permitted by and in strict compliance with GIPS's trademark usage guidelines.

7      OWNERSHIP.
GIPS retains all interests in the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of GIPS (“GIPS Modifications”).

Modifications under this License or on different terms from those contained in this License, or may choose not to license them.

8      TERMINATION.
8.1 This License terminates automatically if You fail to comply with its terms and fail to cure such breach within 28 days of
becoming aware of the breach.




public-ilbc-v0-081009.doc
                                                                                                                                D-3
8.2 If You initiate a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against GIPS alleging that the Original
Code or any GIPS Modification directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You under this License
terminate upon 60 days notice from GIPS unless You either (i) agree in writing to pay GIPS a mutually agreeable reasonable
royalty for Your past and future use of Original Code and GIPS Modifications or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim.
8.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification,
sublicensing, and distribution of the Covered Code, and to destroy all copies of the Covered Code that are in Your possession or
control. Provisions that by their nature should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, including but not limited to
Sections 2.2 “Limitations, 2.5 “Your Grants”, 4 “No Warranty Or Support”, 5 “Limitation Of Liability”, 7 “Ownership”, 8.3
“Effect Of Termination”, 10.3 “Independent Development”, and other applicable provisions of Section 10, survive its
termination. All end user license agreements to the Covered Code (excluding distributors and resellers), if validly granted prior to
termination, survive any termination of this License. No party is liable to any other for compensation, indemnity, or damages of
any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License is without
prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.

9      U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Code is a “commercial item”, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial
computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth in this License.

10     MISCELLANEOUS.
10.1 Relationship. This License may not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, or any other legal
association between You and GIPS, and You may not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, or otherwise.
10.2 Inability To Comply. If it is impossible for You to comply with any term of this License due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible and (b) describe the
limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included with all distributions of Source Code, and should be
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
10.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License impairs GIPS's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for
it, market, or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Original
Code, Covered Code, Modifications, Larger Works, or technology or products You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.
10.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by GIPS to enforce any provision of this License may not be deemed a waiver of future
enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract is construed
against the drafter does not apply to this License.
10.5 Severability. If any provision of this License is unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
permissible and reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the
remainder of this License continues in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if You are unable to comply fully
with Section 2.1 or 2.5, this License terminates immediately and You must immediately discontinue any use of the Covered Code
and destroy all copies of it that are in Your possession or control.
10.6 Dispute Resolution; Governing Law. This License is governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California.
Choice of law rules do not apply, regardless of jurisdiction. Any litigation relating to this License is subject to the jurisdiction of
the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue in San Francisco County, California, and You and GIPS
hereby consent to personal jurisdiction and venue therein with respect to this License. Application of the United Nations
Convention On Contracts For The International Sale Of Goods is expressly excluded. The losing party in any litigation is
responsible for all costs, reasonable attorneys' fees, and expenses.
10.7 Entire Agreement. This License is the parties’ entire agreement with respect to its subject matter.
10.8 If You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they
have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et
tous les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.

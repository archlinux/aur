Subject: [PATCH] serial: 8250: Store to lsr_save_flags after lsr read
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

commit be03b0651ffd8bab69dfd574c6818b446c0753ce upstream.

Not all LSR register flags are preserved across reads. Therefore, LSR
readers must store the non-preserved bits into lsr_save_flags.

This fix was initially mixed into feature commit f6f586102add ("serial:
8250: Handle UART without interrupt on TEMT using em485"). However,
that feature change had a flaw and it was reverted to make room for
simpler approach providing the same feature. The embedded fix got
reverted with the feature change.

Re-add the lsr_save_flags fix and properly mark it's a fix.

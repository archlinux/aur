- Fixed a problem with the recognition of recurrence rules for Exchange events
- Fixed a crash when opening the event details widget of some recurring all-day events

=== Morgen 2.2.0
With Morgen 2.2, we are excited to announce a new tool to help you schedule your meetings. Now you can create One-on-One and Permanent Scheduling Links right in your calendar 🥳. Forget about Calendly, Morgen has you covered for most of the scheduling scenarios!

Here is how it works:

1. Select a few options for your next meeting. Optionally, add the name and email address of your invitee to make the booking page feel more personal.
2. Copy and send the link generated by Morgen. Depending on the scenario, you might want to share the link by email, Slack, Teams, or put it on your webpage.
3. Your invitee visualizes a page displaying your real-time availability and picks a slot. Morgen checks your calendars to ensure no double booking.
4. Done, your meeting is scheduled. Reuse your personal scheduling link every time you need it.

Visit https://morgen.so/scheduling to learn more about Morgen Scheduling Links. 

=== Morgen 2.2.1
Improvements
- The current time indicator is now updated immediately when the timezone is changed
- The "first day of the week" is now a setting decoupled from the Regional date/time format. For example, you can now set Monday as the first day of the week, while keeping the English (United States) as the region
- Morgen now notifies when an update is ready to install by displaying a badge next to the profile icon on Windows and Mac
- The shortcuts Alt+A and Alt+S now behave like toggles, making it easier to turn on/off the task and the scheduler sidebar
- You can now use CTRL+S or CTRL+Enter (resp. Cmd+S or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to save events being edited without touching the mouse
- We reduced the throttle for manual calendar refresh and now Morgen shows a feedback message when CTRL+R is pressed while sync is already in progress

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the connection to Facebook Events calendar feed
- Avoid mixed-language availability text (at the moment, English is enforced)
- Fixed an issue making it impossible to update a single occurrence of an event series when some events in the series had been previously deleted
- Minor improvements to the style of tasks in the calendar
- Cancelled meetings from Exchange and Office 365 are not displayed anymore, consistently with other providers


=== Morgen 2.2.2
Ouch! While improving the stability of Google accounts already connected to Morgen, we have broken the possibility to connect additional Google accounts! This release is only about fixing this issue. Apologies to all affected users 🙏

=== Morgen 2.2.3
Improvements
- Several performance improvements were added. Most notably, the contacts and location autocompletion now run much smoother.
- Authentication with Google and Microsoft are now working more reliably
- General updates for security and performance

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue that could cause the local database to grow disproportionally with some calendar subscriptions
- Fixed a problem preventing Search to find all the relevant events
- Some events were not updated when moved from being all-day events to timed events: this is now solved
- Fixed an issue causing some all-day events to be displayed over two days, instead of one

=== Morgen 2.2.4
Improvements
- When you create a scheduling link, you can now set the limit for booking events in the future up to 12 weeks and there are more options for the minimum notice.
- While searching, it is now possible to use the keyboard tab to switch between Past and Future tabs faster.
- We increased the area where you can grab the window and drag it around. Before it was hard to find the right locations where this was working.
- The shortcut C now creates a new event on the visible day/week, rather than jumping to Today.
- Google introduced an additional step to authenticate: now we provide better guidance on this process.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue making it impossible to edit start/end times for an event in some cases.
- Fixed an issue causing non-native notifications on Linux not to be displayed.
- Fixed a layout issue with timed events expanded to become longer than 24h

=== Morgen 2.2.5
New
- You can now define the auto-refresh interval for calendar subscriptions (iCalendar feeds). If you are working with a highly dynamic calendar, you might want to use a refresh interval of 5, 15, or 60 minutes. Instead, if you know that the calendar does not change often, or if it contains a large number of events, you can set the refresh interval to 1 day to save resources.

Improvements
- We made the parsing of calendar feeds more robust, even for misformatted data.
- We now show a visual warning when a Scheduling link is not fully synchronized with our servers, to make sure you know when a Scheduling link is ready to be shared.
- We now use semicolons to separate attendees when communicating with your default mail client. This improves general compatibility.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the misalignment of the time labels in weekly and daily views, visible when the resolution was set high.
- Fixed a problem with editing the available time slots of Permanent Scheduling Links. The available slots were only visible when editing recent links. Now, they are visible for all links.
- Fixed the Czech and Japanese locale.
- Fixed an issue causing non-native notifications on Linux not to be displayed (yes, was actually not entirely fixed in the previous release)

=== Morgen 2.2.6
Improvements
- Often an event timezone differs from the current local timezone. We have improved the event detail widget to show both the event original time and the time in the local timezone. Moreover, when the start and end timezones are different (long flights are a common example), Morgen now shows both. 

Bug Fixes
- It is now possible to select and copy text from the Notes field of an event that is not editable.
- Fixed an issue causing some yearly events to be displayed every month.
- Fixed an issue preventing the correct update of a weekly event series when the weekday is changed.


=== Morgen 2.3.0
New Features
- Zapier integration

Improvements
-Starting from this release, Morgen persists the latest calendar view settings and restores them when you restart the app. For example, if you normally work on the monthly view, you will start from the same monthly view after a restart. Similarly, if you prefer not to see weekends, you will not need to toggle them off every time anymore.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the calendar widget not appearing when editing the end date of a recurrence
- Fixed parsing of some events, which was causing the end date to be wrong (and in the wrong timezone)
- Fixed notifications with CalDAV calendars, that were not delivered reliably
- Fixed a minor style issue with the notes fields in the Scheduler sidebar tab

=== Morgen 2.3.1
New Features
- Morgen Time Zone Assistant. 

Improvements
- Events marked as "not busy" are now displayed with different color shade to visually set them apart from busy events.
- On Linux, the date-time picker gets format directly from the language and locale settings of the system. This makes the widget more consistent with what you see on web apps running in the browser.
- We improved the way local-only events look like. If you are offline or your connection is unstable, Morgen allows you to continue editing your events. These events, however, are not synchronized with the calendar provider until you are back online, and this release makes this case more apparent.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed a problem causing duplicate events sometimes appearing in the calendar.
- Fixed the connection to some CalDAV services, using non-standard connection ports.

=== Morgen 2.3.2
Bug Fixes
- Fixed a problem making it impossible to remove calendar accounts when the subscription is expired.
- Fixed an issue causing the event details popup to appear out of the screen in some cases.
- Fixed an issue preventing the correct display of error messages during the connection of a calendar account.

=== Morgen 2.3.3
Improvements
- Avoid the flickering of the attendee autocompletion widget while typing.
- Improved the loading time of the scheduling links, that was definitely too long.
- Now the event widget does not move around like crazy while you are changing the time of the event.
- Allow selecting and copying the error message in case of a crash.
- Use Command/CTRL+H to hide and Command/CTRL+M to minimize.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed the positioning of the event widget appearing out of the screen on the Day view.
- Fixed a crash occurring when creating a tag without a name.
- Fixed the visual occlusion for the tag editing tooltip.
- Fixed an issue making it impossible to remove the event description of an event in Exchange.
- Fixed an issue preventing the Quick Join button to appear with many all-day events.
- Fixed time zone helper showing out of the screen on the Day view.

=== Morgen 2.3.4
Improvements
- We have made the size of the Morgen panel when using the Alt+C option the same for the Day and the Week views. This makes the transition smoother and gives more space for events and tasks in the Day view.
- It is now possible to delete a calendar account from a device where the account itself is not authenticated. This covers some edge cases where it was not possible to add or remove an account.

General Fixes
- We disabled the possibility to RSVP to "This & Future occurrences". The reason is that this operation is not really supported by the calendar protocols and could lead to odd behaviors, like duplicate events. You can still RSVP to single occurrences or the entire event series.
- We fixed a problem causing some events not to synchronize with the calendar provider immediately. This was a source of confusion as events would appear in Morgen but not immediately on other devices.
- We fixed a problem delivering event invitations with some providers (e.g. Infomaniak).
- We fixed a problem fetching events from some CalDAV providers.
- We fixed a problem with Google Out-of-office (OOO) events. Before these events were displayed as one day longer than they actually were.
- On a minor note, we fixed the downgrading alert. In general, it is not possible to downgrade Morgen to a previous version. A warning should be displayed if this is detected, but this warning was not displayed on some systems. This is now fixed.

=== Morgen 2.3.5
Morgen developers communicates the same changelog for 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 - so the latter arguably fixes issues of the former.

=== Morgen 2.3.6
Improvements
- Loading calendars with tons of events, especially recurrent ones, is now much faster. This is only the first step towards making Morgen the faster calendar ever.
- The creation of new events now feels more stable. We have fixed the flickering of the event that was occurring after hitting Save.
- We have made several UI adjustments that we hope you'll love! For example, the current time indicator, as well as the color of the calendar to which an event belongs, are now more visible, even when the calendar is crowded.

General Fixes
- We fixed a possible crash sometimes occurring when creating a new event.
- We improved the repositioning of the Morgen windows on Windows when disconnecting an external screen, and make the Alt+C toggling robust to fast switches.
- We fixed an issue pushing events to some CalDAV providers.


=== Morgen 2.4.0
With release 2.4.0, we introduced native integrations with Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. You will be able to create ad-hoc rooms for newly-created events. Morgen will generate a one-time virtual room and attach it to your meeting. This works for events booked via Morgen Scheduling Links as well.

You can still configure your permanent meeting rooms in Morgen settings. While this works best with Zoom, where the concept of a "waiting room" is well designed, Microsoft Teams and Google Meet work better with a one-off link generated for each meeting.

To start with Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, visit the Integrations tab in Morgen settings.

 
Improvements
- on the Week, 2 Weeks, or Month view, you can now click on a date and jump into the Day view for that day
- we gave the event details popup more space to visualize the event notes
- we have changed the look and feel of this changelog, we are now using Headwayapp, and we love it!
 
Bug Fixes
- we fixed an issue preventing the use of Morgen Scheduling Links with some CalDAV providers (namely Zoho and Fastmail)
- the event widget popup was moving too much while editing an event, this is now fixed
- the declining of events on Office 365 or Outlook was erroneously showing an error message, this is now fixed
- we fixed a program that could have caused an infinite loop and related memory leaks in some rare cases
- we fixed a problem preventing the re-scheduling of a task as all-day event


=== Morgen 2.4.1
New Features
- Landing page: You can now organize your Morgen links in a public page accessible at book.morgen.so/<your-name>. You can decide which links should be visible on your personal booking page, and which ones should stay private (only accessible with a direct link). You can also personalize your booking page title and welcome message, as well as the look and feel with your name, company, and logo.
- Email reminders for Morgen Links: We know how easy it is to forget an appointment and we don't want this to happen to your attendees. You can now set Morgen to send email reminders to both you and your attendees for all meetings scheduled through a Morgen link. You can add multiple reminders that will be delivered timely before the start of the appointment.
- White Labeling: Morgen Pro users can now customize the appearance of Morgen link pages, as well as the one of all the emails that are sent to the meeting attendees on your behalf. It is now possible to change your company logo, brand color, and hide references to Morgen.

Improvements
- It is now possible to embed a Morgen link into your web page
- Everyone booking a meeting with you with a Morgen link will now receive an additional confirmation by email, including buttons to add the appointment to the calendar
- The Morgen links are now customizable to look more friendly
- You can now assign a custom name for each of your calendars. This is handy when you have multiple accounts and some of the calendars have the same name
- The attendee autocompletion now also relies on the person's name (before it was only looking at the email address)

Bug Fixes
- We fixed an issue on the Morgen link widget preventing the correct navigation through months
- We fixed an issue that could sometimes cause events to disappear from the calendar view

=== Morgen 2.4.2
New Features
- The native Zoom integration is now available! It took a few weeks for Zoom to perform a security review of Morgen and giving us green light, but finally here it is. As with Google Meet and Microsoft Teams, you can now create an ad-hoc meeting link for each new event scheduled manually or through a Morgen Scheduling link.
- With the start of 2022, we have decided to replace the closed feedback board with a more open roadmap platform that is accessible from both the Morgen app and our website. Open to everyone, no registration required.
- You can now embed your Personal Booking page on your website. A button with the instructions to do so have been added to Morgen.

Improvements
- The one-click Join button for virtual meetings now appears only for meetings you are attending (and not, for example, for meetings that are only on your colleagues calendars)
- Virtual room links are now displayed in the confirmation and reminder emails that are sent to your attendees, when they book a meeting using a Morgen Scheduling link

Bug Fixes
- We fixed the categorisation of some CalDAV calendars, erroneously considered read-only, which was preventing the editing of the events
- We fixed a problem causing some Office 365 accounts to load forever in case of bad internet connection
- We fixed some layout glitches, like the sidebar header moving behind the macOS traffic light buttons and the scheduler tooltip being hardly readable


=== Morgen 2.4.3
New Features:
- We now offer the possibility to set up a static IP address for our scheduler to access your calendar when somebody loads one of your Morgen Scheduling Links. This is important if you need to whitelist our servers on your firewall, for example, Azure Conditional Access. This is an option available on-demand in the Morgen Pro plan. If white-listing a location is enough, you'll just need to know that all the requests come from our servers located in Zurich, Switzerland.
- This release introduces several improvements and fixes for CalDAV calendars. First and foremost, Morgen now fully supports CalDAV delegate access. This means that you can see all calendars that have been shared with you by another person. Before it was only possible to add such calendars by entering their full URL, which was not always easy to find. To see a full list of calendars you have access to, reconnect your account using the "Reconnect" button.

Bug Fixes
- We fixed an issue affecting some recurrent daily events. Depending on the timezone, it could happen that the series would end one day too early or one day too late. This was affecting CalDAV as well as Exchange calendars and has now been fixed.
- Again talking about timezones, we fixed a problem parsing some non-standard timezones on CalDAV, which was preventing the correct visualization of these events.



=== Morgen 2.4.4
Improvements:
- While we are finalizing our next big release (spoiler: starts with T, ends with ODOIST 🤫), here we focus on a number of smaller improvements that you have been asking for in the last few weeks 🙏🏻.
- The event details popup now sticks to its position when the date of the event goes beyond the currently displayed time window.
- Meetings booked with Morgen Scheduling Links now show the attendee's name first, thus making it easier for you to keep track of the person you are talking to.
- The Quick Join button is now displayed only for calendars with read & write access - this filters out read-only calendars of your colleagues.
 
Fixes:
- We fixed a bug preventing the creation of weekly or yearly recurrent events with Exchange/O365.
- We fixed an issue causing sometimes a lag between the creation of an event in Morgen and its propagation to the calendar provider.
- We fixed an issue causing some Exchange delegate calendars not to be displayed.
- We fixed an issue causing some Exchange events not to display the correct RSVP status.
- We fixed an issue causing some all-day events from Google Calendar to be displayed at midnight instead.
- We made several other adjustments that make us proud but are a bit too technical to be shared here ✨

=== Morgen 2.5.0
New Features:
- Native integrations with your favorite tools, such as Todoist, Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do, and Microsoft Email! While you could already import external tasks via Zapier, implementing the proper pipeline with Zapier is sometimes hard (and expensive 💰). We know that the right experience can only be achieved with more tight integration between Morgen and other tools. Starting today, you can integrate Todoist, Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do, and Outlook email directly, without the need for third-party services. This is just the start, more native integrations will come soon.
- Recurrent Tasks: Morgen adds full support for recurrent tasks. If you schedule a Morgen task, you can now decide to set it daily, weekly, monthly, or even to follow more complex patterns. The tasks will appear in your calendar so you can better organize your time.

Improvements:
- Improved Task & Event editor: The Task & Event editor has been reworked to be simpler to use and more consistent. You can now create a task directly from your calendar. We also make the calendar selector easier to find and gave your notes more space.
- A all-new look for your tasks: Tasks scheduled in your calendar will now appear with a new, clean and minimal style. This sets tasks apart from calendar events, so you know what is coming at a glance.
- New toggles to customize Morgen to your needs (Hide completed tasks: Morgen can now automatically hide completed tasks from your calendar - completed tasks are marked as free, so they won't block your calendar. Widen current day: you can now decide whether the current day column in the Weekly and 2 Weeks view should be larger than the others.)

Fixes:
- Fixed a problem of Morgen Scheduling Links with Fastmail calendar.
- Fixed an issue causing links in the event description to duplicate after each change.
- Fixed an issue causing some transparent events to be barely readable.

=== Morgen 2.5.1
New Features:
- Now Morgen can merge identical events appearing on different calendars: events with the same time and identifier are merged, beautifully. At the same time, you keep the ability to edit each instance individually.
 
Improvements:
- We improved the parsing of external .ics files, making it more robust to malformed data.
- We increased the sensitive area for clicks on events, thus making the selection of very short events easier.
- We made the creation of new events in the calendar more precise, with the event starting time now rounded according to the "Time Dragging Resolution" setting, instead of "Time Display Resolution".
 
Fixes:
- The confirmation dialog for actions on calendar events was displayed even when not necessary. This has been fixed now.
- We fixed event invitations with some CalDAV providers.
- We fixed a problem causing the creation of events to be in a hanging state for too long.
- We fixed the Notes field, where links were not clickable anymore in the latest release.
- We fixed a bug causing deleted tags to remain set on events in a sort of invisible state 👻.

=== Morgen 2.5.2
Fixes:
- with recent updates, some CalDAV providers started reporting errors while trying to update or create an event. Morgen 2.5.2 fixes this issue.


=== Morgen 2.5.3
New Features:
- This release contains mostly internal changes to power the awesome features that are coming next, but there is also some great news.
- In the free plan, the number of meetings that can be booked with a Morgen Scheduling Link increases from 5/month to unlimited! The free includes one active Recurrent Scheduling Link at a time, while One-time Scheduling Links remain unlimited. Not yet explored the full potential of Morgen Scheduling Links? Visit morgen.so/schedule-meetings-with-ease to see how this can simplify your scheduling.

Fixes:
- We are also bringing some fixes for problems that have been reported to us, for example
- We fixed an issue saving events with some CalDAV providers.
- We fixed a problem causing tasks lists to disappear when renamed using an empty title.

=== Morgen 2.5.4
New Features:
- We have made some major redesign to our onboarding to guide you through the configuration and first steps with Morgen. This will arguably benefit new users first, but it is the foundation of a proper Help Center that will help everyone use Morgen at its full potential!

Improvements:
- An improved Month view, where the current day is better highlighted and the time of the events is visible again 😉.
- We made private Office 365 / Exchange events actually private - it turns out that Microsoft does not redact the private information from your private events. Instead, Microsoft confidently relies on calendar clients to do that 🤔.
- We added some more options for the duration and buffer time of the Morgen Scheduling Links.

Fixes:
- We resolved an issue while moving an event from one calendar to another. Before, the event was often not deleted from the old calendar, thus resulting in a duplicate.
- We fixed a couple of small glitches, with Tasks and Scheduling Links.
- We fixed a bug causing inconsistent calendar names in different parts of the Morgen app interface.

=== Morgen 2.5.5
New Features:
- Flexible Week: Sometimes you want to focus on the near future, sometimes you want to plan ahead. For every use case, Morgen now allows you to quickly customize your week view to display 1 to 10 days. Use Command+number on macOS and CTRL+number on Linux and Windows.
- Consistent with the Todoist integration, Morgen now displays subtasks from Microsoft To Do.

Improvements:
- Improved visualization of calendar events that end at midnight.
- It's now possible to switch calendar views using shortcuts when creating or editing a one-time link.

Fixes:
- Automatic logouts on Linux using Snaps
- Google Meet links now correctly redirect to the default browser.
- Fixed some formatting issues in the scheduling link reminders.
- Morgen no longer sends out outdated reminders for booked meetings that have been cancelled or rescheduled by the organizer.

=== Morgen 2.5.6
New Features:
- Markdown support: We’re excited to introduce markdown support for task names, letting you highlight what’s most important. You can now style task names, applying bold, italic, or hyperlinks. Since markdown to-dos are common in Todoist, imported tasks will now maintain their style when displayed in Morgen, both in the sidebar and calendar.

 
Improvements:
- New: Danish date-time locale
- New: Right-click contextual menu in the Agenda view
- Improved: More robust parsing of malformed CalDAV events
- Improved: Calendar refresh icon is consistent with the sidebar
 
Fixes:
- An issue that occurred when copying an event where the new timezone differs from the original one has been fixed
- Morgen custom notifications on Linux are back on track
- We fixed an issue that caused possible double bookings from scheduling links when clicking twice on the Confirmation button

	* 1:1.8.7.108.g0390bc97e-1 :
	Changed package versioning scheme: now includes upstream version and git
	  info to match what MicroPython REPL banner shows.
	Removed 'readline' from depends, MicroPython now uses its own readline
	  implementation.
	Removed 'pip-setuptools' and 'pip-virtualenv' from optdepends, the
	  'pip-micropython' tool is deprecated and not installed anymore.
	Adapted to upstream changes in compilation procedure.
	Added workround to fix compilation errors in axtls due to leaking of
	  -Werror in CFLAGS from top-level Makefile in makepkg build environment.

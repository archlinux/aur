    exports the envelope of any type of layer supported by OpenJUMP
    (Layer.class, ReferencedImageStyle.class, WMSLayer.class, WFSLayer.class,
    RasterImageLayer.class) as geometry. Layer name, layer datasource (if any)
    and CRS (only for WMS and WFS) are saved as layer attributes
  * Add a "Style" plugin to WMS Layer dialog. 
    Currently only Visibility by scale is available
  * Substituted ExportEnvelopeAsGeometryPlugIn Raster plugIn with
    more general ExportLayerableEnvelopeAsGeometryPlugIn

    (used HTMLPanel.class), Info can be saved as HTML file
  * Added very first version of Oracle Spatial Support in Data Store Layer 
    Wizard, based on Geotools gt2-oracle-spatial.jar to load geometry from 
    ORA structure efficiently.
    Current features: 
       - Lists geometry tables grouped by schemas (user connection schema is 
         considered as the default schema)
       - Loads Oracle geometry tables storing POINT, LINESTRING, POLYGON and
         MULTI*. Does not manage other Oracle spatial types (topology, raster
         etc.)
       - Handles several geometry columns (other geometric columns are 
         converted to WKT)
       - Efficient data loading based on Larry Reader DB Plugin code
  * Replaced DataStore Combobox displaying each layer in a DataStore by a 
    TreeTable based on Netbeans Swing Outline component. Multiple layers can 
    be selected in the tree.
    Layers are grouped by schemas in the tree.
    Limit, Where Clause and Caching properties can be edited in the table
  * Extended inspection to multiband raster layers.

      default nodata
  * FR 215 : don't open a new ViewAttributesFrame if there is already one
    open for the selected layer Layer
  * Manage new attribute types BOOLEAN and LONG in jml and shp drivers
    (also manage other datatypes so that they can be written as one
    of the well-known datatype instead of throwing an error message)
  * Hide unused AttributeType from the schema.
    Add a way to nullify attribute values in the Attribute panel :
    - String and boolean : press left button, and click on null menu item
    before releasing
    - Date and numerics : just empty the field
  * Added ChangeRangeValuesToNoDataPlugIn.
    This plugin allows to change a range of cell values (of a Sextante single
    band raster layer) to nodata value. An option allowas to extract only the
    input range of value (and set the other values to nodata)
  * Layer tree tooltip is now configurable via "Configure tooltip"
    in Option panel - 2 options :
    - original minimal JUMP/OpenJUMP tooltip
    - advanced info tooltip
    Use different colors (red and blue) to display layers with no datasource 
    and modified layers with datasource in the tooltips
  * FR #220 : add an option to snap on feature being edited. Indeed, the new
    snap policy is applied on LineString edition only as snapping on a polygon
    being edited tends to create invalid polygons

Version 1.3.1 (released on 6.December.2009)

  This release includes
  
  The OpenJUMP version 1.3.1 is primarily a maintenance release to solve a

  for working with PostGIS queries, compared to version 1.3. 

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.3.0 (released on 19.April.2009)

  This release includes
  
  New Features:

    from the OpenJumpConfiguration file.
  - Added new command-line parameter "-default-plugins" to load a "second"
    properties file. Plugins read from a properties file with

    in the /bin/ directory of OpenJUMP. (Note: using two properties files
    enables to separate general OJ plugins from own functions)
  - Added Multi-Ring-Buffer Function for selected objects (a similar function
    can be found in ArcGIS:
    http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/

    polygons under /Tools/Two Layers/. The function allows in
    a second step to transfer the attributes from both
    source layers.
  - Enabled loading of Mr.SID layers using the new OpenFramework
    (note: problems exist with deleting the temp-jpg-files in

  - added Replace attribute value by copy from an other attribute 
            org.openjump.sigle.plugin.replace.ReplaceValuePlugIn.java   
  - added Extract by Geometry Type on layer name context menu.         
  - added the LayerPropertiesPlugIn which adds a menu item
            "Layer Properties" to the Layer Name popup menu.  This
            feature will display layer information such as name, number
            of features, number of points, number of attributes, geometry type,
            DataSource class, and source path.  It works on single or multiple
            layer selections.  It also includes a transparency adjustment slider
            that works for layer selections.
  - added an option to "Write world file" in the Save Image As dialog.

          This makes it possible to stop text from rendering when zoomed out
          too far to actually read it
  - added a Zoom Realtime tool to the toolbar.  This tool uses
          image stretching to simulate the zoom before it occurs for an
          accurate preview.
                       
  Changes in the user interface:

          Sidebar picture  previews the current options.
          It copies attributes by default, even from selections on multiple
          layers, but this can beturned off.
          Supports setting the number of segments in a quarter circle.
  - added a VertexZValue style and 
    internationalized the VertexXYLineSegment style
  - Make snap points to the grid or to vertices possible

       enables offline working with local WMSs.
  - fixed File->Save View as Raster bug with the Metal L&F that caused
    the save file name text box to dissappear.
      Moved the Save World File check box to the top of the dialog.
      Also added an X edit box that defaults to the view's X width,
      but can be changed to any value up to 3800 to save a high resolution
      image.  A fence icon appears to the left of the X box if there is a fence
      layer, indicating that it will be used in place of the view window to
      define the picture bounds.
  - improved the PastePlugin to support point coordinates in the form (1.0,1,1)
       or (1 1 1) with any amount of white space. Multiple points can be pasted
       at the same time.
  - added support for plug-ins to have their own I18N resource bundles.
  - fixed styling bug [1691836] 
  - fixed reading of TIFF rasters with world files.
  - better error message for WMS Query bug: [1748657]

  - improved the windows and UNIX startup scripts
  - fixed conf directory location in openjump.sh and removed batik sub dir
  - closed the shape file after it was read to allow it to be deleted.
  - SchemaPanel height set to 20 to have a readable combo box
          with the MetalLookAndFeel
  - Bug fixed in SaveDatasetAsPlugIn [bug 1770783]: now display the
          layer name in the file chooser
  - Bug fixed in LoadDatasetPlugIn : refresh the file list each time the
          plugin is called
  - added -state command line option to specify a directory where
          the workbench-state.xml file should be stored (or a file name).
        * Updated the openjump.sh script to set the -state directory to
          $HOME/.jump/.
  - improvements to Simple Query: Put resulting layer in standard
    Result category, and added a listener to update comboboxes when
    layers are added to the task
  - added right click on Layer View menu item 
    "Select Layers with Selected Items".
    Made setSelectedLayers() public in TreeLayerNamePanel to support
    this function.
  - fixed the internal string problem in DbfFile reader with large datasets
    where every attribute value was different by adding exception handler
    that stops further interns
  - fixed the problem with the toolbar selection arrow tool
          losing the feature selection when right clicking.
  - fixed problem in Color Theming Style Panel with all cells
          displaying a fill pattern when any one was set using Custom.
  - fixed a problem with the Toggle Visibility Layer Name
          popup menu item.  It was totally nonfunctional.

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2.0 D (16.Aug.2007)

this version is equivalent to following nightly built: openjump-20070816-0019

Bugfixes and Improvements done since release of OpenJUMP 1.2 B:

- fixed a problem with the window turning black when an Image Layer was added
  due to the graphics context composite being changed.
- added support for mouse wheel zooming when the zoom cursor is over 
- set default SRID to -1 for PostGIS
- fixed a bug (submitted by Hisaji Ono) where some edges had
          wrong links to faces. The method has been entirely rewritten.
- added a warning message in language files to manage the case where one
  tries to transfer attributes from an heterogeneous layer with
  PlanarGraphPlugIn
- fixed a bug in Simple Query PlugIn (responsible of confusion between the
  three static taget options : all layers / selection / selected layers
- ShapefileWriter: added that an Exception is thrown, when layer geometries
  are of different type. 
  Data aren't saved then. (otherwise the user wonders when only polygons
  are stored)
- removed openjump-mac.sh file since the new openjump.sh
  file works under MAC-OSX as well
- set EditTransaction.ROLLING_BACK_INVALID_EDITS_KEY = true when starting up
  OJUMP (i.e. invalid geometries are not alowed per default, switch
  can be done in Edit Options Panel)
- Tried to fix issue
  http://sourceforge.net/tracker/
    index.php?func=detail&aid=1246588&group_id=118054&atid=679906
  instead fixed the issue for SaveImageAsSVGPlugin and SaveProjectAsPlugin.
- Added context menu entry on layer list that allows changing the layer name.
  Changed ToggleVisibilityPlugin to allow changing WMS layer visibility
  toggling.
- The WMS field remembers the last used server address.
- resolved LoadDatasetPlugIn "ok" button problem on MacOSX.
  The problem was caused by the validation method that always
  returned false. The workaround does not use validation, but
  only for MacOSX computers. To check the OS a new class was added.
- WMS layers use the title now instead of the WMS layer name.
  While editing WMS requests, moving layers up/down caused the SRS
  box to switch back to the first available SRS, this was fixed.
- updated the demo.deegree.org URL to a working value.
- Default output is UTF-8 now instead of ISO-8859-1, fixing encoding
          problems in resulting XML files.
- added fix by Malte to avoid null-pointer excpetion when making a copy of a
          FeatureCollection containing Features with null values for attributes.
          (see jpp-devel email send by sstein on 24.July.2007)
- replaced jmat_5.0.jar by the cleaned up version jmat_5.0m.jar wich does only
          contain the org.jmat packages. 
- Bug fix in LabelStyle : added trim() to avoid labels to be ex-centered
- Bug fix : thick closed lines (and polygons) did not have a nice
          join_bevel on the first/last point (tip from Larry Becker)
- improvement: scripts/openjump.sh: Added improved startup script for Unix from
          Paul Austin.
- improvement: Add UnionByAttributePlugIn in the Tool/Analysis menu
- Remove several plugins related to loading/saving files and which are
          no more useful (two plugins in the workbench.ui.plugin package and
          two other plugins in the datasource package)
- improvement: Add automatic file extension in the main SaveDatasetAsPlugIn
          and put the format chooser at the bottom of the dialog (as in SkyJUMP)
- Fix a bug in the Comparator used to sort geometries and
          improve union performance.
- improvement: for expensive BasicStyle construction 
  (slowed down colour theming a lot)
- improvement: added dissolve beanshell script by Hisaji
- Fix a problem with TaskFrame
          closing (related to bug 1726629) : now, every internal frames
          related to a TaskFrame (table view or info frame) are closed
          before the TaskFrame (with a confirmation dialog)
- Fix the "Closing Cloned Window" bug (1475013) : now, layer manager
          resources are released only when the last internal frame using it
          is closed.
- Fix bug 1691834 about labelling (can label above, on are below
          lines again)
- improvement: Backport Larry's bug-fix to enable
          workbench-properties file outside the IDE (see bug 1726102)
- Fix     Add double-quotes around column names to be able to query
          mixed-case column names. There may be a similar bug for schema
          and table names (see bug report 1694304), but this happens
          somewhere else in the code.
- improvement:
          Several optimization to be able to visualize data as wireframes
          while dragging the zoombar, even with big features and large
          dataset (use of Java2DConverter decimator, selection of large
          data instead of random data, elimination of invisible layers in
          the feature selection...)
- improvement: Including SkyJUMP's improvements concerning
  the rendering pipeline (point coordinates decimation, selection renderer)
- Fix the memory leak problem
          when removing a Layer (the LayerRender cache was not freed)
- Improvement: Cache last WMS result with a SoftReference
- Improvement: Union can now union a layer or a selection, like
          in SkyJUMP
- Improve segments extracter -> optionally removes segments
          appearing several times like the JCS equivalent plugin and
          optionally merge the result)
- fixed bug: line width textField set on the same line as the line
          width slider in the basic style panel
- fixed bug: "End feathers" decoration appeared on wrong end
- fixed bug 1713295 (Snap always on)

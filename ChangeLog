        * new syntax for let rec/corec with flavor specifier
        * optional parameters added to the syntax of definitions

          it denotes an object provided not as defined by the user, but as generated by another ITP
        * the command "defined" is added as a presentational alternative to "qed" for definitions
        * improved standard library and contributions
        * improved binaries using matita components
        * source code updated for the latest version of OCaml and related tools

	* old kernel, unification, etc. removed
	* new compact syntax for tactics
	* improved automation
	* experimental multi tabbed interface
	* John Major equality and the computation version of the K axiom are
	  now in the standard library
	* generation of inversion/destruct principles using either
	  Leibniz or John Major equalities
	* several bug fixes

0.5.7 - 15/02/2009 - Pàdoa release
	* are_convertible bug solved, arguments of application where 
	  compared allowing cumulativity. This allowed to prove Type0=Type1.
	* cases tactic speedup in the simplest case of an inductive type 
	  hose right parameters have all to be abstracted when the outtype is
	  built
	* maction support added to output notation (adopted for "=" that 
	  expands to "= \sub T" to show the equality type)
	* generation of derived lemmas rewritten to be based on hooks that
	  are triggered every definition
	* composition of coercions fixed, more composite are generated
	* undo mechanism for coercions remade, should work better
	* new command "prefer coercion foo" to reorder coercions.
	* UTF-8 eq classes and virtuals described in the manual and
	  consistently printed in the TeX/UTF-8 table
	* added a memory system for UTF-8 equivalence classes, so that
	  last choice is remembered and attempted first next time the same
	  eq class is walked trough
	* some core notation fixed to allow a better setoid-path
	  representation (foo ^-1 changed precedence)
	* matita manual updated with a section regarding the usage of 
	  the liveCD with the VirtualBox emulator
	* liveCD fixed to allow to easily mount/unmount real host folders
	  with VirtualBox
	* ttf-freefont package added to the liveCD together with gucharmap
	* coercions from convertible types are not inserted for real, they
	  just behave as hints for the unification algorithm
	* virtuals (eq classes) fixed w.r.t. greek letters
	* some virtuals added to ease the writing of diamond (<>), box ([])
	  and upper bar (_).
	* code that generates eliminators fixed to use whd ~delta set to true
	  when counting products, this allows to used definitions as inductive
	  type ariety.
	* match ... with rendering fixed to break the box containing
	  constructors arguments if needed (i.e. record projections
	  are now almost readable)
	* fixed pattern matching over ast terms, Ast.Case construct can be
	  matched correctly. Look the o-algebra example if you are
	  intereseted.
	* Mpadded MathML tag can be used in notation, it allows to overlap
	  symbols reducing the bounding box size 

0.5.6 - 1/12/2008 - bugfix release
	* more abstract disambiguation algorithm, simpler instantiation
	  to a different CIC/refiner
	* natural deduction support improved in the first order case
	* natural deduction lem rule does now support lemmas 
	  with (up to) 3 premises (multicut rule, displayed as
	  a collapsed tree)

0.5.5  - 17/11/2008 - bugfix release with students in mind	
	* by ... we proved fixed to use only the specified lemmas but
	  using full unification inside auto.
	* new apply rule tactic, that exploits the goal type to
	  disambiguate the input term.
	* new didactic/ library directory, with support for natural deduction
	  treese.

0.5.4  - 19/10/2008 - bugfix release	
	* When a file is opened, the cursor is placed at the begin of the
	  buffer and not atthe end as before
	* New macro eval
	* More code in the direction of a fully functional matita status, that
	  improved undo reliability in the parser/notation modules
	* matitac was seldom compiling up-to-date files, fixed
	* Memory consumption durin proof construction cut down using Lazy.t
	  proof terms
	* mstyle support in notation for text color, font size
	* AutoGui now scales fonts to the correct user-requested size 
	* Non linear pattern matching from the level of terms to the
	  one of content in interpretation command (if the same variable name
	  is used, the two captured terms must be alpha equivalent to match)

0.5.3  - 23/7/2008 - bugfix release
	* many fixes concerning the CProp hiearchy
	* coercion database simplified
	* coercion hiding now works properly for coercions to funclass
	* triangular pullback works better with coercions to the function space
	* notation for lists fixed to add a break point after the separator
	* notation for the existential is now user definable
	* \infrule layout added, allows to display readable fractions
	* better window for terms grammar and TeX/Unicode
	* fixed a bug in the positivity check not considering some subterms
	* fixed some GUI glitches thanks to glade-3

0.5.2  - 2/7/2008 - better-usability-for-the-working-constructivist release
	* refinement of match fixed to prevent useless unfolding,
	  head_beta_reduce is used instead of whd ~delta:true
	* CProp hierarchy, interleaved with type (used to be a single universe)
	* Notation now allows to set the precedence level of subterms, avoiding
	  unnecessary parenthese
	* UTF-8 / TeX conversion table is now available in the Help menu
	* Notation subsystem described in the manual
	* EBNF term grammar is now available in the View menu (and is in sync with
	  the currently loaded notation)
	* Rewrite tactic (in hypothesis) now computes the right sort and
	  uses the right equality elimination principle
	* URI free interpretation and coercion statements (scripts are almost
	  relocatable now)
	* elim and cases tactic now support a pattern to specify hypotheses that 
	  are generalized before the elimination. 

0.5.1  - 29/5/2008 - minor bug fix release
	* visualization of inductive types reports the number of fixed parameters
	* a wrong context was used to refine fixpoints arguments
	  when trying to optimize out the letin (grep for `AvoidLetIn):
	  (let rec f x = Fix... in f t ---> Fix... t)
	* auto fixed to prefer goals with metavariables to closed ones,
	  added new syntax to specify the universe "auto by t1, t2, ...",
		updated documentation describing all auto parameters
	* declarative language syntax and documentation ported to the new 
	  auto parameters

0.5.0  - 9/5/2008 - bugfix release
	* first release not considered experimental

0.4.98 - ??/11/2007 - bugfix release
	* compiles against camlp5 >= 5.0  
	* changed lablgtksourceview module name since it is now part of lablgtk2

0.4.97 - 16/11/2007 - initial release

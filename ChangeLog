	* 3.6-1 :
	Version bump.

	Upstream changelog:
	- Major Changes:
	  - AMIDST is now under GPL v3
	  - Completely reworked the profile selector.
	  - Added automatic seed histories. If AMIDST detects a "history.txt" file next to it, it will write a time stamp followed by the seed for each seed you enter.
	  - Added smooth fragment fading. (This may be disabled in the options menu) Enabling this will cause all fragments to fade in when loaded.
	  - Most crashes now create a "crash dialog" containing a log that can easily be pasted.
	  - A licenses window has been added to the help menu. This will contain all relevant license information for AMIDST and its libraries.
	  - Added option to set the default world type to any of the world types or "prompt each time".
	  - Switching maps no longer eats up extra memory. (This will be a huge improvement in memory/processing performance when loading new maps)
	  - Rendering speeds have been vastly improved.
	  - Fixed issue where files would not be properly closed.
	- Minor Changes/Fixes:
	  - Hidden files/folders now show when opening a world from a file/folder.
	  - Added 1.7.4 to official version list.
	  - A new option is availible in the Options menu called "Show Debug Info". Enabling this will add a small panel to the map viewer containing debug information on fragments.
	  - Library loading now follows OS rules correctly. (This should fix a number of errors with loading)
	  - AMIDST now returns "4" on crashes. This will change at a later date to include various error codes.
	  - Mac OS X users should no longer experience the "corrupted" issue.
	- Command Line Support:
	  - Added a "-mcpath <file>" flag for users to specify the path to their .minecraft directory.
	  - Added "-log <file>" flag. Using this flag will cause AMIDST to write all log output to the specified file. AMIDST should create a file if it does not exist.
	  - Added "-history <file>" to specify where AMIDST should write seed history to. If AMIDST cannot find a file at the path you've specified, it will attempt to make one.
	- Biome Color Profiles:
	  Overview: This was something that was added in 3.5, but I've improved on a bit for 3.6. Color profiles let you set what color each biome shows up as. To activate them, simply create a folder named "biome" next to AMIDST. After launching AMIDST again, a new file should appear in that folder called "default.js". It will contain the default options for a color profile. You may edit this directly, or create new color profiles within the folder (following the same design as default.js). Any subdirectories will show up as sub-menus. (There is also support for shortcuts, as mentioned in this post)
	  - Added support for biome nicknames. (Example: [ "Ice Plains", { "alias":"Really cold place", "r":255, "g":255, "b":255 } ] )
	  - Duplicate biome colors are now supported.
	  - default.json is not much cleaner.
	  - Biome profiles no longer cause an empty profile list when there's a syntax error.
	  - A new menu option for reloading your list of biome color profiles has been added.

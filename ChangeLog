	* lwjgl-2.8.0 :
	First PKGBUILD for the library.
	The reason we install it all in /usr/share/ and not in Java's library path, is
	that this is not recommended by the LWJGL developers. The libraries should
	rather be included in the development project it self. See
	http://lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Downloading_and_Setting_Up_LWJGL
	for additional information

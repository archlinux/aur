GRANT AND TERM OF LICENSE. In exchange for and subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this Agreement, CIRRUS LOGIC grants to Company a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable License (“License”) to install and internally use the Software Tools only for the Purpose stated below from the date the Software Tools are downloaded by Company. Subject to compliance with Clause 5, Company may permit use of the Software Tools and any Evaluation Board(s) by its Affiliates, and those consultants and contractors that are not competitors of CIRRUS LOGIC, provided (a) all such use relates to the Purpose and (b) Company shall be responsible for the acts and omissions of all such third parties. “Affiliate” means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control of a party. The License shall terminate at the earliest of: (a) immediately upon any failure by Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement or in the event of the insolvency of the Company; (b) immediately if Company infringes any of the intellectual property rights of CIRRUS LOGIC and/or its licensors (whether the rights are the subject of this License or otherwise), such termination being without prejudice to the legal rights and remedies of CIRRUS LOGIC and/or its licensors, who shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other damages they may be entitled to; (c) upon notice from CIRRUS LOGIC if its rights to sub-license any third party rights in the Software Tools are terminated; or (d) upon mutual agreement in writing by the parties.

RESTRICTIONS. The Software Tools and any Evaluation Board(s) are provided solely for Company’s internal use for the purpose of enabling the use of a CIRRUS LOGIC semiconductor device in Company’s end product(s) by configuring hardware or firmware settings or developing firmware to run on an embedded core or providing stimulus to the CIRRUS LOGIC device (collectively, the “Purpose”), and Company agrees not to use the Software Tools and/or any Evaluation Boards for any other purpose. Where the Software Tools are used to create a binary image of CIRRUS LOGIC firmware which is then used with, or embedded within, a CIRRUS LOGIC semiconductor device, the use of such firmware, is governed by the terms of the CIRRUS LOGIC “Software License Agreement”. Other code created by Company using the Software Tools is not licensed by CIRRUS LOGIC, and no responsibility is accepted by CIRRUS LOGIC for such code. Company is responsible for determining the suitability of any updates to firmware provided with the Software Tools, and for code created using the Software Tools, provided that CIRRUS LOGIC may require Company to cease using a version of the Software, and may require use of an update, where (a) a third party has claimed that the Software infringes its intellectual property rights, and/or (b) for technical reasons CIRRUS LOGIC is no longer able to permit ongoing use of the version of the Software being used by Company. Supply of the Software Tools and/or any Evaluation Boards does not convey a License nor imply any rights to implement or distribute any Software Tools or the output image file in any finished end user product or ready-to-use final product, nor to distribute any Evaluation Boards. Company may make a reasonable number of copies of CIRRUS LOGIC Software Tools in connection with the Purpose. Except as permitted under Clause 1, or unless it receives prior written consent from CIRRUS LOGIC to do so, Company may not transfer or sub-license, either temporarily or permanently, any right to use the Software Tools and/or any Evaluation Board under this Agreement. Company agrees not to: i) otherwise copy, adapt or reproduce the Software Tools, and/or any Evaluation Boards; ii) modify, decompile, disassemble, translate or reverse engineer the Software Tools, and/or any Evaluation Boards (other than as permitted by law); iii) decode, decrypt the Software Tools in whole or in part; or remove, circumvent or neutralize any security measures incorporated therein; iv) sell, assign, encumber, time share, rent, lease, lend, distribute, localize, or port the Software Tools, and/or any Evaluation Boards, allow remote access to the Software Tools, and/or any Evaluation Boards, or place the Software Tools on any publicly accessible internet site; or v) manufacture or create derivative works of the Software Tools, and/or any Evaluation Boards, or grant anyone a license to engage in similar conduct. For Software Tools which includes tools proprietary to CIRRUS LOGIC’s licensor Synopsys International Limited (“Synopsys”), Company acknowledges and agrees that any license to use such tools: i) is time locked, and unless otherwise advised by CIRRUS LOGIC shall be for a maximum period of 12 months; ii) is specific to the geographic location for which the license is issued (as advised by Company); iii) is not sub-licensable by Company; iv) is granted on the condition that Company undertakes not to infringe Synopsys’ intellectual property rights. If Company requests support during the License and/or thereafter, CIRRUS LOGIC has no obligation to provide any such support but if it agrees to do so it has the right to charge for its service. The Software Tools may incorporate, or link to, programs or libraries created using open source code. Company must comply with relevant license terms relating to such code. Such terms may be provided to Company with the Software Tools or may be otherwise notified to Company.

TERMINATION. Within ten (10) days of the termination of the License, Company agrees that it will return to CIRRUS LOGIC all copies of the Software Tools, and all Evaluation Boards provided to Company by CIRRUS LOGIC, or, upon the written permission of CIRRUS LOGIC, Company may destroy any copies of the Software Tools, including any original, backup or archival copy Company may have installed, downloaded or recorded on any computer, memory system, or magnetic or optical medium. Upon written request from CIRRUS LOGIC, an officer of Company will certify in writing that it has complied with this provision and has not retained any copies of the Software Tools, or any Evaluation Boards. The terms of this Agreement shall remain in effect notwithstanding termination or expiry of a License, and (unless otherwise advised by CIRRUS LOGIC) will govern subsequent Licenses of Software Tools, and Evaluation Boards, provided by CIRRUS LOGIC. The Agreement may be terminated by CIRRUS LOGIC by providing notice in writing to that effect.

GENERAL PROVISIONS. This Agreement and each License governed by this Agreement, are not assignable, transferable or (other than as permitted hereunder) sub-licensable by Company without the prior written consent of CIRRUS LOGIC, and any attempt to do so shall be void. CIRRUS LOGIC may at any time sub-license, assign, novate, charge or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without Company’s consent. CIRRUS LOGIC may amend part or all of the Agreement, by giving at least fifteen days written notice to the Company. If Company does not agree to any such amendments it shall be entitled to terminate the relevant License and (if it elects) this Agreement. Any notice, report, approval or consent required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given if delivered personally or mailed by first class, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid to the respective published principal or registered addresses of the parties. The waiver by either party of a breach of this Agreement or any right hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach of this Agreement; nor shall any delay by either party to exercise any right under this Agreement operate as a waiver of any such right. If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in, and shall be construed pursuant to the laws of, the State of Texas and the United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions thereof. Both parties hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of Texas and the locale of Austin therein. The prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to recover costs and expenses including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees. The parties agree that a material breach of this Agreement adversely affecting CIRRUS LOGIC and/or its licensors’ proprietary rights in the Software Tools and/or the Evaluation Boards would cause irreparable injury to CIRRUS LOGIC for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and that CIRRUS LOGIC and its licensors shall be entitled to equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between Company and CIRRUS LOGIC with respect to the Software Tools and Evaluation Boards provided pursuant to this Agreement and supersedes any other agreement between Company and CIRRUS LOGIC with respect thereto (including terms presented and/or accepted as part of an installation process), but does not otherwise replace, modify or cancel any other agreement between Company and CIRRUS LOGIC. If there is any inconsistency between these terms and those presented as part of the process to install the Software Tools, these terms will prevail.

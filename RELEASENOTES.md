=====

* fix install

=====

* keep version number similiar to mulle-bootstrap


3.4.1
=====

* Improve finding of the tests folder.
* mulle-craft --tests-path will output the tests folder path

=====

Keep version in lockstep with mulle-bootstrap for the moment.

=====

Lot's of changes to be in lock-step with mulle-bootstrap. One nice feature
gained is mulle-analyze (you need mulle-scan-build or scan-build) for it to
work.

0.10.5
=====

More stupidity fixes..

0.10.4
=====

Aimless dicking around with --prefix and --homebrew, because I am kind of
on holiday and brain is turned off. Sorry.


0.10.3
=====

Fix a version check

0.10.2
=====

--homebrew and --prefix are no mutually incompatible, which makes
the most sense.

0.10.1
=====

--homebrew option needs to be after --prefix for linuxbrew
compatibility.


0.10.0
=====

Depends now on mulle-bootstrap 2.5 and incorporates internal changes to
support it.
mulle-install is now more efficient installing single libraries, that do
not need to fetch the dependencies.

--no-build-dependencies does not imply --no-install-dependencies anymore.

to the search path.

* improve fail output


0.8.1
=====

* pass all flags -D*|-W* to cmake

0.8.0
=====

* mulle-craft assumes mulle-bootstrap is installed besides it, if it is, that
becomes its preferential path for it
* allow to specify cmake commandline flags with -DCMAKE (will not get passed
to mulle_bootstrap)
* add --dump-environment as a debug option

0.7.0
=====

* adapt to mulle-bootstrap 2.4.0

0.6.1
=====

* pass --debug to ./build-test.sh

=====

=====

* mulle-update is more verbose and better at detecting remotes, who are not
named "origin"

0.5.2
=====

* be more verbose when tagging

0.5.1
=====

* fix use of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
* remove some unnecesary refresh calls to make things go faster

0.5
===

Mostly changes how flags are interpreted and passed to mulle-bootstrap.

* change -nb flag to -nbd

0.4
===

* Much improved documentation
* Fix mulle-clean a bit

0.3
===

* base code on mulle-bootstrap library functions for exekutor and logging
* add multiple options
* check for mulle-bootstrap version
* rename project from mulle-install to mulle-craft
* do local command first, mulle-bootstrap later (f.e. for tagging). That way
more numerous local failures don't dirty dependencies.
* this version needs to be pushed out now, because I need it in travis.yml

0.2
===

* allow to specify a tag and a scm for URL install

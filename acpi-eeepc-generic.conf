# Put your username in "XUSER". It _is_ important.
#
# Some defaults are defined, but
# they might not work on your system. For example, the task manager
# used is "lxtask", which is part of the LXDE desktop environment.
# You can install it with "pacman -S lxtask". You can use
# something else if you want, just be sure to edit the appropriate
# variable.
#
#################################################################
# Format:
# Format of the settings is as follow:
#   VARIABLE_NAME=("command number 1" "command number 2" "etc.")
#
#################################################################
# Note that:
#   -Commands with spaces _need_ to be double-quoted
#   -You can put as many commands as you want, as in the previous example
#   -Some defaults are provided which might not work on your
#    system. Please edit as your liking. Look at
#    COMMANDS_WIFI_POST_UP for example. It uses by
#    default "wicd" for for network management. It is killed and
#    re-run to save battery. If you don't use wicd, please remove
#    it from the commands to run!!!
#   -All commands are executed as root. To execute a command as
#    yourself (not root), put @ in front of the command. This allow
#    graphical applications to work.
#   -If a key is not working, uncomment KEY_SHOW. It will show
#    you the code of the key you pressed. Then report it to me
#    with your model number.
#   -Change your wifi module. By default it uses "rt2860sta", which
#    is the one used in the 901/1000*.
#   -You can choose between different OSD:
#       libnotify: by default (GTK), you need "notification-daemon"
#       knotify: OSD used by KDE, you need "kdebase"
#       dzen: Small OSD, you need "dzen2"
#       NONE: You guessed it... none :)

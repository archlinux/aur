Release Notes
=============

2.1.126
-------

This release fixes a long standing (> 4 years old!) concurrency bug
when building the same sdist for the 1st time and racing another Pex
process doing the same sdist build.

* Guard against racing sdist builds. (#2080)
  `PR #2080 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2080>`_

2.1.125
-------

This release makes ``--platform`` and ``--complete-platform`` resolves
and locks as permissive as possible. If such a resolve or lock only has
an sdist available for a certain project, that sdist will now be used if
it builds to a wheel compatible with the specified foreign platform(s).

* Attempt "cross-builds" of sdists for foreign platforms. (#2075)
  `PR #2075 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2075>`_

2.1.124
-------

This release adds support for specifying ``--non-hermetic-venv-scripts``
when building a ``--venv`` PEX. This can be useful when integrating with
frameworks that do setup via ``PYTHONPATH`` manipulation.

Support for Pip 23.0.1 and setuptools 67.4.0 is added via
``--pip-version 23.0.1``.

Additionally, more work towards hardening Pex against rare concurrency
issues in its atomic directory handling is included.

* Introduce ``--non-hermetic-venv-scripts``. (#2068)
  `PR #2068 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2068>`_

* Wrap inter-process locks in in-process locks. (#2070)
  `PR #2070 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2070>`_

* Add support for Pip 23.0.1. (#2072)
  `PR #2072 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2072>`_

2.1.123
-------

This release fixes a few ``pex3 lock create`` bugs.

There was a regression introduced in Pex 2.1.122 where projects that
used a PEP-518 ``[build-system] requires`` but specified no
corresponding ``build-backend`` would fail to lock.

There were also two long standing issues handling more exotic direct
reference URL requirements. Source archives with names not following the
standard Python sdist naming scheme of
``<project name>-<version>.{zip,tar.gz}`` would cause a lock error. An
important class of these is provided by GitHub's magic source archive
download URLs. Also, although local projects addressed with Pip
proprietary support for pure local path requirements would lock, the
same local projects addressed via
``<project name> @ file://<local project path>`` would also cause a lock
error. Both of these cases are now fixed and can be locked successfully.

When locking with an ``--interpreter-constraint``, any resolve
traversing wheels using the ``pypyXY`` or ``cpythonXY`` python tags
would cause the lock to error. Wheels with this form of python tag are
now handled correctly.

* Handle ``[build-system]`` with no build-backend. (#2064)
  `PR #2064 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2064>`_

* Handle locking all direct reference URL forms. (#2060)
  `PR #2060 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2060>`_

* Fix python tag handling in IC locks. (#2061)
  `PR #2061 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2061>`_

2.1.122
-------

This release fixes posix file locks used by Pex internally and enhances
lock creation to support locking sdist-only C extension projects that
do not build on the current platform. Pex is also updated to support
``--pip-version 22.3.1`` and ``--pip-version 23.0``, bringing it up to
date with the latest Pip's available.

* Support the latest Pip releases: 22.3.1 & 23.0 (#2056)
  `PR #2056 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2056>`_

* Lock sdists with ``prepare-metadata-for-build-wheel``. (#2053)
  `PR #2053 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2053>`_

* Fix ``execute_parallel`` "leaking" a thread. (#2052)
  `PR #2052 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2052>`_

2.1.121
-------

This release fixes two bugs brought to light trying to interoperate with
Poetry projects.

* Support space separated markers in URL reqs. (#2039)
  `PR #2039 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2039>`_

* Handle file:// URL deps in distributions. (#2041)
  `PR #2041 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2041>`_

2.1.120
-------

This release completes the ``--complete-platform`` fix started in
Pex 2.1.116 by #1991. That fix did not work in all cases but now does.

PEXes run in interpreter mode now support command history when the
underlying interpreter being used to run the PEX does; use the
``PEX_INTERPRETER_HISTORY`` bool env var to turn this on.

Additionally, PEXes built with the combination
``--layout loose --venv --no-venv-site-packages-copies`` are fixed to
be robust to moves of the source loose PEX directory.

* Fix loose --venv PEXes to be robust to moves. (#2033)
  `PR #2033 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2033>`_

* Fix interpreter resolution when using --complete-platform with --resolve-local-platforms (#2031)
  `PR #2031 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2031>`_

* Support REPL command history. (#2018)
  `PR #2018 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2018>`_

2.1.119
-------

This release brings two new features. The venv pex tool now just warns when
using ``--compile`` and there is a ``*.pyc`` compile error instead of failing
to create the venv. Also, a new ``PEX_DISABLE_VARIABLES`` env var knob is added
to turn off reading all ``PEX_*`` env vars from the environment.

* Ignore compile error for PEX_TOOLS=1 (#2002)
  `PR #2002 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2002>`_

* Add PEX_DISABLE_VARIABLES to lock down a PEX run. (#2014)
  `PR #2014 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2014>`_

2.1.118
-------

This is a very tardy hotfix release for a regression introduced in Pex
2.1.91 by #1785 that replaced sys.argv[0] with its fully resolved path.
This prevented introspecting the actual file path used to launch the PEX
which broke BusyBox-alike use cases.

There is also a new ``--non-hermetic-scripts`` option accepted by the
``venv`` tool to allow running console scripts with ``PYTHONPATH``
adjustments to the ``sys.path``.

* Remove un-needed realpathing of ``sys.argv[0]``. (#2007)
  `PR #2007 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2007>`_

* Add ``--non-hermetic-scripts`` option to ``venv`` tool. (#2010)
  `PR #2010 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/2010>`_

2.1.117
-------

This release fixes a bug introduced in Pex 2.1.109 where the released
Pex PEX could not be executed by PyPy interpreters. More generally, any
PEX created with interpreter constraints that did not specify the Python
implementation, e.g.: ``==3.8.*``, were interpreted as being CPython
specific, i.e.: ``CPython==3.8.*``. This is now fixed, but if the
intention of a constraint like ``==3.8.*`` was in fact to restrict to
CPython only, interpreter constraints need to say so now and use
``CPython==3.8.*`` explicitly.

* Fix interpreter constraint parsing. (#1998)
  `PR #1998 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1998>`_

2.1.116
-------

This release fixes a bug in ``--resolve-local-platforms`` when
``--complete-platform`` was used.

* Check for --complete-platforms match when --resolve-local-platforms (#1991)
  `PR #1991 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1991>`_

2.1.115
-------

This release brings some attention to the ``pex3 lock export``
subcommand to make it more useful when inter-operating with
``pip-tools``.

* Sort requirements based on normalized project name when exporting (#1992)
  `PR #1992 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1992>`_

* Use raw version when exporting (#1990)
  `PR #1990 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1990>`_

2.1.114
-------

This release brings two fixes for ``--venv`` mode PEXes.

* Only insert "" to head of sys.path if a venv PEX runs in interpreter mode (#1984)
  `PR #1984 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1984>`_

* Map pex python path interpreter to realpath when creating venv dir hash. (#1972)
  `PR #1972 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1972>`_

2.1.113
-------

This is a hotfix release that fixes errors installing wheels when there
is high parallelism in execution of Pex processes. These issues were a
regression introduced by #1961 included in the 2.1.112 release.

* Restore AtomicDirectory non-locked good behavior. (#1974)
  `PR #1974 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1974>`_

2.1.112
-------

This release brings support for the latest Pip release and includes
some internal changes to help debug intermittent issues some users are
seeing that implicate what may be file locking related bugs.

* Add support for ``--pip-version 22.3``. (#1953)
  `PR #1953 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1953>`_

2.1.111
-------

This release fixes resolving requirements from a lock using arbitrary
equality (``===``).

In addition, you can now "inject" runtime environment variables and
arguments into PEX files such that, when run, the PEX runtime ensures
those environment variables and command line arguments are passed to
the PEXed application. See `PEX Recipes
<https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes.html
#uvicorn-and-other-customizable-application-servers>`_ for more
information.

* Fix lock resolution to handle arbitrary equality. (#1951)
  `PR #1951 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1951>`_

* Support injecting args and env vars in a PEX. (#1948)
  `PR #1948 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1948>`_

2.1.110
-------

This release fixes Pex runtime ``sys.path`` scrubbing for cases where
Pex is not the main entry point. An important example of this is in
Lambdex where the AWS Lambda Python runtime packages (``boto3`` and
``botocore``) are leaked into the PEX runtime ``sys.path``.

* Fix ``sys.path`` scrubbing. (#1946)
  `PR #1946 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1946>`_

2.1.109
-------

This release brings musllinux wheel support and a fix for a regression
introduced in Pex 2.1.105 by #1902 that caused ``PEX_PATH=`` (an
exported ``PEX_PATH`` with an empty string value) to raise an error in
almost all use cases.

* Vendor latest packaging; support musllinux wheels. (#1937)
  `PR #1937 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1937>`_

* Don't treat ``PEX_PATH=`` as ``.`` like other PATHS. (#1938)
  `PR #1938 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1938>`_

2.1.108
-------

This release fixes a latent PEX boot performance bug triggered by
requirements with large extras sets.

* Fix slow PEX boot time when there are many extras. (#1929)
  `PR #1929 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1929>`_

2.1.107
-------

This release fixes an issue handling credentials in git+ssh VCS urls
when creating locks.

* Fix locks for git+ssh with credentials. (#1923)
  `PR #1923 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1923>`_

2.1.106
-------

This release fixes a long standing bug in handling direct reference
requirements with a local version component.

* Unquote path component of parsed url requirements (#1920)
  `PR #1920 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1920>`_

2.1.105
-------

This is a fix release which addresses issues related to build time
work_dir creation, virtualenv, and sh_boot support.

In the unlikely event of a UUID collision in atomic workdir creation,
pex could overwrite an existing directory and cause a corrupt state.
When building a shell bootable ``--sh-boot`` pex the
``--runtime-pex-root`` was not always respected based on the condition
of the build environment, and the value of the PEX_ROOT.

* Fail on atomic_directory work_dir collision. (#1905) 
  `PR #1905 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1905>`_

* Use raw_pex_root when constructing sh_boot pexes. (#1906)
  `PR #1906 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1906>`_

* Add support for offline downloads (#1898)
  `PR #1898 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1898>`_

2.1.104
-------

This release brings a long-awaited upgrade of the Pip Pex uses, but
behind a ``--pip-version 22.2.2`` flag you must opt in to. Pex will then
use that version of Pip if it can (your Pex operations target Python
``>=3.7``) and warn and fall back to the older vendored Pip (20.3.4) if
it can't. To turn the need to fallback to older Pip from a warning into
a hard error you can also specify ``--no-allow-pip-version-fallback``.

The ``pex3 lock update`` command now gains the ability to update just
the index and find links repos the lock's artifacts originate from by
using a combination of ``--no-pypi``, ``--index`` & ``--find-links``
along with ``--pin`` to ensure the project versions stay pinned as they
are in the lockfile and just the repos they are downloaded from is
altered. Consult the CLI ``--help`` for
``--fingerprint-mismatch {ignore,warn,error}`` to gain more control over
repo migration behavior.

There are several bug fixes as well dealing with somewhat esoteric
corner cases involving changing a PEX ``--layout`` from one form to
another and building artifacts using certain interpreters on macOS 11.0
(aka: 10.16).

* Add support for Pip 22.2.2. (#1893)
  `PR #1893 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1893>`_

* Make lock update sensitive to artifacts. (#1887)
  `PR #1887 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1887>`_

* Ensure locally built wheel is consumable locally. (#1886)
  `PR #1886 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1886>`_

* Ensure ``--output`` always overwrites destination. (#1883)
  `PR #1883 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1883>`_

2.1.103
-------

This release fixes things such that pex lockfiles can be created and
updated using the Pex PEX when local projects are involved.

* Fix ``pex3 lock ...`` when run from the Pex PEX. (#1874)
  `PR #1874 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1874>`_

2.1.102
-------

This is a hotfix release that fixes a further corner missed by #1863 in
the Pex 2.1.101 release whereby Pex would fail to install
platform-specific packages on Red Hat based OSes.

In addition, an old but only newly discovered bug in
``--inherit-path={prefer,fallback}`` handling is fixed. Previously only
using ``PEX_INHERIT_PATH={prefer,fallback}`` at runtime worked properly.

In the process of fixing the old ``--inherit-path={prefer,fallback}``
bug, also fix another old bug handling modern virtualenv venvs under
Python 2.7 during zipapp execution mode PEX boots.

* Fix wheel installs: account for purelib & platlib. (#1867)
  `PR #1867 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1867>`_

* Fix ``--inhert-path`` handling. (#1871)
  `PR #1871 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1871>`_

* Error using pex + virtualenv >=20.0.0 + python 2.7 (#992)
  `Issue #992 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/992>`_
  `PR #1871 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1871>`_

2.1.101
-------

This release fixes a corner-case revealed by python-certifi-win32 1.6.1
that was not previously handled when installing certain distributions.

* Make wheel install ``site-packages`` detection robust. (#1863)
  `PR #1863 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1863>`_

2.1.100
-------

This release fixes a hole in the lock creation ``--target-system``
feature added in #1823 in Pex 2.1.95.

* Fix lock creation ``--target-system`` handling. (#1858)
  `PR #1858 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1858>`_

2.1.99
------

This release fixes a concurrency bug in the ``pex --lock ...`` artifact
downloading.

* Fix ``pex --lock ...`` concurrent download errors. (#1854)
  `PR #1854 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1854>`_

2.1.98
------

This releases fixes regressions in foreign ``--platform`` handling and
artifact downloading introduced by #1787 in Pex 2.1.91 and #1811 in
2.1.93.

In addition, PEXes can now be used as ``sys.path`` entries. Once on the 
``sys.path``, via ``PYTHONPATH`` or other means, the code in the PEX can
be made importable by first importing ``__pex__`` either as its own
stand-alone import statement; e.g.: ``import __pex__; import psutil`` or
as a prefix of the code to import from the PEX; e.g.:
``from __pex__ import psutil``.

* Tags should be patched for --platform. (#1846)
  `PR #1846 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1846>`_

* Add support for importing from PEXes. (#1845) 
  `PR #1845 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1845>`_

* Fix artifact downloads for foreign platforms. #1851
  `PR #1851 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1851>`_

2.1.97
------

This release patches a hole left by #1828 in the Pex 2.1.95 release
whereby, although you could run a PEX under a too-long PEX_ROOT you
could not build a PEX under a tool-long PEX_ROOT.

*  Avoid ENOEXEC for Pex internal --venvs. (#1843)
   `PR #1843 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1843>`_

2.1.96
------

This is a hotfix release that fixes ``--venv`` mode
``PEX_EXTRA_SYS_PATH`` propogation introduced in Pex 2.1.95 to only
apply to ``sys.executable`` and not other Pythons.

*  Fix ``--venv`` ``PEX PEX_EXTRA_SYS_PATH`` propagation. (#1837)
   `PR #1837 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1837>`_

2.1.95
------

This release brings two new ``pex3 lock`` features for
``--style universal`` locks.

By default, universal locks are created to target all operating systems.
This can cause problems when you only target a subset of operating
systems and a lock transitive dependency that is conditional on an OS
you do not target is not lockable. The new
``--target-system {linux,mac,windows}`` option allows you to restrict
the set of targeted OSes to work around this sort of issue. Since PEX
files currently only support running on Linux and Mac, specifying
``--target-system linux --target-system mac`` is a safe way to
pre-emptively avoid these sorts of locking issues when creating a
universal lock.

Previously you could not specify the ``--platform``\s or
``--complete-platform``\s you would be using later to build PEXes with
when creating a universal lock. You now can, and Pex will verify the
universal lock can support all the specified platforms.

As is usual there are also several bug fixes including properly
propagating ``PEX_EXTRA_SYS_PATH`` additions to forked Python processes,
fixing ``pex3 lock export`` to only attempt to export for the selected
target and avoiding too long shebang errors for ``--venv`` mode PEXes in
a robust way.

* Fix ``PEX_EXTRA_SYS_PATH`` propagation. (#1832)
  `PR #1832 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1832>`_

* Fix ``pex3 lock export``: re-use ``--lock`` resolver. (#1831)
  `PR #1831 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1831>`_

* Avoid ENOEXEC for ``--venv`` shebangs. (#1828)
  `PR #1828 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1828>`_

* Check lock can resolve platforms at creation time. (#1824)
  `PR #1824 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1824>`_

* Support restricting universal lock target os. (#1823)
  `PR #1823 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1823>`_

2.1.94
------

This is a hotfix release that fixes a regression introduced in Pex
2.1.93 downloading certain sdists when using ``pex --lock ...``.

* Fix ``pex --lock ...`` handling of sdists. (#1818)
  `PR #1818 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1818>`_

2.1.93
------

This release brings several new features in addition to bug fixes.

When creating a PEX the entry point can now be any local python script
by passing ``--exe path/to/python-script``.

The ``pex3 lock update`` command now supports a ``-dry-dun check`` mode
that exits non-zero to indicate that a lock needs updating and the
``-p / --project`` targeted update arguments can now be new projects to
attempt to add to the lock.

On the bug fix front, traditional zipapp mode PEX files now properly
scrub ``sys.displayhook`` and ``sys.excepthook`` and their teardown
sequence has now been simplified fixing logging to stderr late in
teardown.

Finally, ``pex3 lock create`` now logs when requirement resolution is
taking a long time to provide some sense of progress and suggest
generic remedies and ``pex --lock`` now properly handles
authentication.

* Support adding new requirements in a lock update. (#1797)
  `PR #1797 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1797>`_

* Add ``pex3 lock update --dry-run check`` mode. (#1799)
  `PR #1799 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1799>`_

* Universal locks no longer record a ``platform_tag``. (#1800)
  `PR #1800 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1800>`_

* Support python script file executable. (#1807)
  `PR #1807 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1807>`_

* Fix PEX scrubbing to account for sys.excepthook. (#1810)
  `PR #1810 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1810>`_

* Simplify ``PEX`` teardown / leave stderr in tact. (#1813)
  `PR #1813 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1813>`_

* Surface pip download logging. (#1808)
  `PR #1808 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1808>`_

* Use pip download instead or URLFetcher. (#1811)
  `PR #1811 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1811>`_

2.1.92
------

This release adds support for locking local projects.

* Add support for local project locking. #1792
  `PR #1792 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1792>`_

2.1.91
------

This release fixes ``--sh-boot`` mode PEXes to have an argv0 and
exported ``PEX`` environment variable consistent with standard Python
boot PEXes; namely the absolute path of the originally invoked PEX.

* Fix ``--sh-boot`` argv0. (#1785)
  `PR #1785 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1785>`_

2.1.90
------

This release fixes Pex handling of sdists to be atomic and also fixes
lock files to be emitted ending with a newline. In addition, many typos
in Pex documentation were fixed in a contribution by Kian-Meng Ang.

* Ensure Pip cache operations are atomic. (#1778)
  `PR #1778 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1778>`_

* Ensure that lockfiles end in newlines. (#1774)
  `PR #1770 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1774>`_

* Fix typos (#1773)
  `PR #1773 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1773>`_

2.1.89
------

This release brings official support for CPython 3.11 and PyPy 3.9 as
well as long needed robust runtime interpreter selection.

* Select PEX runtime interpreter robustly. (#1770)
  `PR #1770 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1770>`_

* Upgrade PyPy checking to latest. (#1767)
  `PR #1767 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1767>`_

* Add 3.11 support. (#1766)
  `PR #1766 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1766>`_

2.1.88
------

This release is a hotfix for 2.1.86 that handles unparseable
``~/.netrc`` files gracefully.

* Just warn when ``~/.netrc`` can't be loaded. (#1763)
  `PR #1763 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1763>`_

2.1.87
------

This release fixes ``pex3 lock create`` to handle relative ``--tmpdir``.

* Fix lock save detection to be more robust. (#1760)
  `PR #1760 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1760>`_

2.1.86
------

This release fixes an oversight in lock file use against secured custom
indexes and find links repos. Previously credentials were passed during
the lock creation process via either ``~/.netrc`` or via embedded
credentials in the custom indexes and find links URLs Pex was configured
with. But, at lock use time, these credentials were not used. Now
``~/.netrc`` entries are always used and embedded credentials passed via
custom URLS at lock creation time can be passed in the same manner at
lock use time.

* Support credentials in URLFetcher. (#1754)
  `PR #1754 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1754>`_

2.1.85
------

This PyCon US 2022 release brings full support for Python interpreter
emulation when a PEX is run in interpreter mode (without an entry point
or else when forced via ``PEX_INTERPRETER=1``).

A special thank you to Loren Arthur for contributing the fix in the

primary artifacts.

* Fix universal lock creation for ICs. (#1738)
  `PR #1738 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1738>`_

2.1.82

introduced in the 2.1.81 release by #1727.

* Fix prerelease handling when checking resolves. (#1732)
  `PR #1732 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1732>`_

2.1.81
------

This release brings a fix to Pex resolve checking for distributions
built by setuptools whose ``Requires-Dist`` metadata does not match a
distibutions project name exactly (i.e.: no PEP-503 ``[._-]``
normalization was performed).

* Fix Pex resolve checking. (#1727)
  `PR #1727 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1727>`_

2.1.80
------

This release brings another fix for pathologically slow cases of lock
creation as well as a new ``--sh-boot`` feature for creating PEXes that
boot via ``/bin/sh`` for more resilience across systems with differing
Python installations as well as offering lower boot latency.

* Support booting via ``/bin/sh`` with ``--sh-boot``. (#1721)
  `PR #1721 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1721>`_

introducing support for ``--no-compression`` to allow picking the the
time-space tradeoff you want for your PEX zips.

* Fix pathologic lock creation slowness. (#1707)
  `PR #1707 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1707>`_

* Support uncompressed PEXes. (#1705)
  `PR #1705 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1705>`_

via the new ``--lock`` flag.

* Avoid deadlock error when run in parallel. (#1694)
  `PR #1694 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1694>`_

2.1.74
------

This release fixes multiplatform ``--lock`` resolves for sdists that are
built to multiple platform specific wheels and it also introduces
support for VCS requirements in locks.

* Add support for locking VCS requirements. (#1687)
  `PR #1684 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1687>`_

* Fix ``--lock`` for multiplatform via sdists. (#1689)
  `PR #1684 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1689>`_

2.1.73
------

This is a hotfix for various PEX issues:

#. ``--requirements-pex`` handling was broken by #1661 in the 2.1.71
   release and is now fixed.
#. Creating ``universal`` locks now works using any interpreter when the
   resolver version is the ``pip-2020-resolver``.
#. Building PEXes with ``--lock`` resolves that contain wheels with
   build tags in their names now works.

* Fix ``--requirements-pex``. (#1684)
  `PR #1684 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1684>`_

* Fix universal locks for the ``pip-2020-resolver``. (#1682)
  `PR #1682 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1682>`_

* Fix ``--lock`` resolve wheel tag parsing. (#1678)
  `PR #1678 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1678>`_

2.1.72
------

This release fixes an old bug with ``--venv`` PEXes initially executed
with either ``PEX_MODULE`` or ``PEX_SCRIPT`` active in the environment.

* Fix venv creation to ignore ambient PEX env vars. (#1669)
  `PR #1669 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1669>`_

2.1.71
------

This release fixes the instability introduced in 2.1.68 by switching to
a more robust means of determining venv layouts. Along the way it
upgrades Pex internals to cache all artifacts with strong hashes (
previously sha1 was used). It's strongly recommended to upgrade or use
the exclude ``!=2.1.68,!=2.1.69,!=2.1.70`` when depending on an open
ended Pex version range.

* Switch Pex installed wheels to ``--prefix`` scheme. (#1661)
  `PR #1661 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1661>`_

2.1.70
------

This is another hotfix release for 2.1.68 that fixes a bug in
``*.data/*`` file handling for installed wheels which is outlined in
`PEP 427
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#installing-a-wheel-distribution-1-0-py32-none-any-whl>`_

* Handle ``*.data/*`` RECORD entries not existing. (#1644)
  `PR #1644 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1644>`_

2.1.69
------

This is a hotfix release for a regression introduced in 2.1.68 for a
narrow class of ``--venv`` ``--no-venv-site-packages-copies`` mode
PEXes with special contents on the ``PEX_PATH``.

*  Fix venv creation for duplicate symlinked dists. (#1639)
   `PR #1639 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1639>`_

2.1.68
------

This release brings a fix for installation of additional data files in
PEX venvs (More on additional data files `here
<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/deprecated/distutils/setupscript.html?highlight=data_files#installing-additional-files>`_)
as well as a new venv install ``--scope`` that can be used to create fully
optimized container images with PEXed applications (See how to use this feature `here
<https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes.html#pex-app-in-a-container>`_).

* Support splitting venv creation into deps & srcs. (#1634)
  `PR #1634 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1634>`_

* Fix handling of data files when creating venvs. (#1632)
  `PR #1632 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1632>`_

2.1.67
------

This release brings support for ``--platform`` arguments with a
3-component PYVER portion. This supports working around
``python_full_version`` environment marker evaluation failures for
``--platform`` resolves by changing, for example, a platform of
``linux_x86_64-cp-38-cp38`` to ``linux_x86_64-cp-3.8.10-cp38``. This is
likely a simpler way to work around these issues than using the
``--complete-platform`` facility introduced in 2.1.66 by #1609.

* Expand ``--platform`` syntax: support full versions. (#1614)
  `PR #1614 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1614>`_

2.1.66
------

This release brings a new ``--complete-platform`` Pex CLI option that
can be used instead of ``--platform`` when more detailed foreign
platform specification is needed to satisfy a resolve (most commonly,
when ``python_full_version`` environment markers are in-play). This,
paired with the new ``pex3 interpreter inspect`` command that can be
used to generate complete platform data on the foreign platform machine
being targeted, should allow all foreign platform PEX builds to succeed
exactly as they would if run on that foreign platform as long as
pre-built wheels are available for that foreign platform.

Additionally, PEXes now know how to set a useable process name when the
PEX contains the `setproctitle` distribution. See
`here <https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1.66/recipes.html#long-running-pex-applications-and-daemons>`_
for more information.

* Add support for ``--complete-platform``. (#1609)
  `PR #1609 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1609>`_

* Introduce ``pex3 interpreter inspect``. (#1607)
  `PR #1607 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1607>`_

* Use setproctitle to sanitize ``ps`` info. (#1605)
  `PR #1605 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1605>`_

* Respect ``PEX_ROOT`` in ``PEXEnvironment.mount``. (#1599)
  `PR #1599 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1599>`_

2.1.65
------

This release really brings support for mac universal2 wheels. The fix
provided by 2.1.64 was partial; universal2 wheels could be resolved at
build time, but not at runtime.

* Upgrade vendored packaging to 20.9. (#1591)
  `PR #1591 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1591>`_

2.1.64
------

This release brings support for mac universal2 wheels.

* Update vendored Pip to 386a54f0. (#1589)
  `PR #1589 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1589>`_

2.1.63
------

This release fixes spurious collision warnings & errors when building
venvs from PEXes that contain multiple distributions contributing to the
same namespace package.

* Allow for duplicate files in venv population. (#1572)
  `PR #1572 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1572>`_

2.1.62
------

This release exposes three Pip options as Pex options to allow building
PEXes for more of the Python distribution ecosystem:

#. ``--prefer-binary``: To prefer older wheels to newer sdists in a
   resolve which can help avoid problematic builds.
#. ``--[no]-use-pep517``: To control how sdists are built: always using
   PEP-517, always using setup.py or the default, always using whichever
   is appropriate.
#. ``--no-build-isolation``: To allow distributions installed in the
   environment to be seen during builds of sdists. This allows working
   around distributions with undeclared build dependencies by
   pre-installing them in the environment before running Pex.

* Expose more Pip options. (#1561)
  `PR #1561 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1561>`_

2.1.61
------

This release fixes a regression in Pex ``--venv`` mode compatibility
with distributions that are members of a namespace package that was
introduced by #1532 in the 2.1.57 release.

* Merge packages for ``--venv-site-packages-copies``. (#1557)
  `PR #1557 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1557>`_

2.1.60
------

This release fixes a bug that prevented creating PEXes when duplicate
compatible requirements were specified using the pip-2020-resolver.

* Fix Pex to be duplicate requirement agnostic. (#1551)
  `PR #1551 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1551>`_

2.1.59
------

This release adds the boolean option ``--venv-site-packages-copies`` to
control whether ``--venv`` execution mode PEXes create their venv with
copies (hardlinks when possible) or symlinks. It also fixes a bug that
prevented Python 3.10 interpreters from being discovered when
``--interpreter-constraint`` was used.

* Add knob for --venv site-packages symlinking. (#1543)
  `PR #1543 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1543>`_

* Fix Pex to identify Python 3.10 interpreters. (#1545)
  `PR #1545 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1545>`_

2.1.58
------

This release fixes a bug handling relative ``--cert`` paths.

* Always pass absolute cert path to Pip. (#1538)
  `PR #1538 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1538>`_

2.1.57
------

This release brings a few performance improvements and a new `venv`
pex-tools ``--remove`` feature that is useful for creating optimized

https://pex.readthedocs.io doc generation and fixing help for
``pex-tools`` / ``PEX_TOOLS=1 ./my.pex`` pex tools invocations that have
too few arguments.

* Add official support for Python 3.10 (#1512)
  `PR #1512 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1512>`_

* Always register global options. (#1511)
  `PR #1511 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1511>`_

* Fix RTD generation by pinning docutils low. (#1509)
  `PR #1509 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1509>`_

2.1.54
------

This release fixes a bug in ``--venv`` creation that could mask deeper
errors populating PEX venvs.

* Fix ``--venv`` mode short link creation. (#1505)
  `PR #1505 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1505>`_

2.1.53
------

This release fixes a bug identifying certain interpreters on macOS
Monterey.

Additionally, Pex has two new features:

#. It now exposes the ``PEX`` environment variable inside running PEXes
   to allow application code to both detect it's running from a PEX and
   determine where that PEX is located.
#. It now supports a ``--prompt`` option in the ``venv`` tool to allow
   for customization of the venv activation prompt.

* Guard against fake interpreters. (#1500)
  `PR #1500 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1500>`_

* Add support for setting custom venv prompts. (#1499)
  `PR #1499 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1499>`_

* Introduce the ``PEX`` env var. (#1495)
  `PR #1495 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1495>`_

2.1.52
------

This release makes a wider array of distributions resolvable for
``--platform`` resolves by inferring the ``platform_machine``
environment marker corresponding to the requested ``--platform``.

* Populate ``platform_machine`` in ``--platform`` resolve. (#1489)
  `PR #1489 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1489>`_

2.1.51
------

This release fixes both PEX creation and ``--venv`` creation to handle
distributions that contain scripts with non-ascii characters in them
when running in environments with a default encoding that does not
contain those characters under PyPy3, Python 3.5 and Python 3.6.

* Fix non-ascii script shebang re-writing. (#1480)
  `PR #1480 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1480>`_

2.1.50
------

This is another hotfix of the 2.1.48 release's ``--layout`` feature that
fixes identification of ``--layout zipapp`` PEXes that have had their
execute mode bit turned off. A notable example is the Pex PEX when
downloaded from https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/releases.

* Fix zipapp layout identification. (#1448)
  `PR #1448 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1448>`_

2.1.49
------

This is a hotfix release that fixes the new ``--layout {zipapp,packed}``
modes for PEX files with no user code & just third party dependencies
when executed against a ``$PEX_ROOT`` where similar PEXes built with the
old ``--not-zip-safe`` option were were run in the past.

* Avoid re-using old ~/.pex/code/ caches. (#1444)
  `PR #1444 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1444>`_

2.1.48
------

This releases introduces the ``--layout`` flag for selecting amongst the
traditional zipapp layout as a single PEX zip file and two new directory
tree based formats that may be useful for more sophisticated deployment
sceanrios.

The ``--unzip`` / ``PEX_UNZIP`` toggles for PEX runtime execution are
now the default and deprecated as explicit options as a result. You can
still select the venv runtime execution mode via the
``--venv`` / ``PEX_VENV`` toggles though.

* Remove zipapp execution mode & introduce ``--layout``. (#1438)
  `PR #1438 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1438>`_

2.1.47
------

This is a hotfix release that fixes a regression for ``--venv`` mode
PEXes introduced in #1410. These PEXes were not creating new venvs when
the PEX was unconstrained and executed with any other interpreter than
the interpreter the venv was first created with.

* Fix ``--venv`` mode venv dir hash. (#1428)
  `PR #1428 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1428>`_

* Clarify PEX_PYTHON & PEX_PYTHON_PATH interaction. (#1427)
  `PR #1427 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1427>`_

2.1.46
------

This release improves PEX file build reproducibility and requirement
parsing of environment markers in Pip's proprietary URL format.

Also, the `-c` / `--script` / `--console-script` argument now supports
non-Python distribution scripts.

2.1.45
------

This is a hotfix release that fixes the ``--bdist-all`` handling in the
``bdist_pex`` distutils command that regressed in 2.1.43 to only create
a bdist for the first discovered entry point.

* Requirement parsing handles local non-dist files. (#1190)
  `PR #1190 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1190>`_

2.1.25
------

This release brings support for a ``--venv`` execution mode to complement ``--unzip`` and standard
unadorned PEX zip file execution modes. The ``--venv`` execution mode will first install the PEX
file into a virtual environment under ``${PEX_ROOT}/venvs`` and then re-execute itself from there.
This mode of execution allows you to ship your PEXed application as a single zipfile that
automatically installs itself in a venv and runs from there to eliminate all PEX startup overhead
on subsequent runs and work like a "normal" application.

There is also support for a new resolution mode when building PEX files that allows you to use the
results of a previous resolve by specifying it as a ``-pex-repository`` to resolve from. If you have
many applications sharing a requirements.txt / constraints.txt, this can drastically speed up
resolves.

  `PR #1148 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1148>`_

2.1.24
------

This release upgrades Pip to 20.3.3 + a patch to fix Pex resolves using
the ``pip-legacy-resolver`` and ``--constraints``. The Pex package is
also fixed to install for Python 3.9.1+.

* Upgrade to a patched Pip 20.3.3. (#1143)
  `Issue #9283 <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9283>`_
  `PR #1143 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1143>`_

* Fix python requirement to include full 3.9 series. (#1142)
  `PR #1142 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1142>`_

2.1.23
------

This release upgrades Pex to the latest Pip which includes support for
the new 2020-resolver (see:
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#resolver-changes-2020) as well
as support for macOS BigSur. Although this release defaults to the
legacy resolver behavior, the next release will deprecate the legacy
resolver and support for the legacy resolver will later be removed to
allow continuing Pip upgrades going forward. To switch to the new
resolver, use: `--resolver-version pip-2020-resolver`.

* Upgrade Pex to Pip 20.3.1. (#1133)
  `PR #1133 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1133>`_

2.1.22
------

This release fixes a deadlock that could be experienced when building
PEX files in highly concurrent environments in addition to fixing
`pex --help-variables` output.

A new suite of PEX tools is now available in Pex itself and any PEXes
built with the new `--include-tools` option. Use
`PEX_TOOLS=1 pex --help` to find out more about the available tools and
their usage.

Finally, the long deprecated exposure of the Pex APIs through `_pex` has
been removed. To use the Pex APIs you must include pex as a dependency
in your PEX file.

  `PR #1099 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1099>`_

2.1.20
------

This release improves interpreter discovery to prefer more recent patch versions, e.g. preferring
Python 3.6.10 over 3.6.8.

We recently regained access to the docsite, and https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ is now
up-to-date.

* Prefer more recent patch versions in interpreter discovery. (#1088)
  `PR #1088 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1088>`_

* Fix readthedocs doc generation. (#1081)
  `PR #1081 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1081>`_

2.1.19
------

This release adds the ``--python-path`` option, which allows controlling the
interpreter search paths when building a PEX.

The release also removes ``--use-first-matching-interpreter``, which was a misfeature. If you want to use
fewer interpreters when building a PEX, use more precise values for ``--interpreter-constraint`` and/or
``--python-path``, or use ``--python`` or ``--platform``.

* Add ``--python-path`` to change interpreter search paths when building a PEX. (#1077)
  `PR #1077 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1077>`_

  `PR #1076 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1076>`_

* Encapsulate ``--inherit-path`` handling. (#1072)
  `PR #1072 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1072>`_

2.1.18
------

This release brings official support for Python 3.9 and adds a new ``--tmpdir`` option to explicitly
control the TMPDIR used by Pex and its subprocesses. The latter is useful when building PEXes in
space-constrained environments in the face of large distributions.

The release also fixes ``--cert`` and ``--client-cert`` so that they work with PEP-518 builds in
addition to fixing bytecode compilation races in highly parallel environments.

* Add a ``--tmpdir`` option to the Pex CLI. (#1068)
  `PR #1068 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1068>`_

* Honor ``sys.executable`` unless macOS Framework. (#1065)

  `PR #1063 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1063>`_

* Add atomic_directory exclusive mode. (#1062)
  `PR #1062 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1062>`_

* Fix ``--cert`` for PEP-518 builds. (#1060)
  `PR #1060 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1060>`_

2.1.17
------

This release fixes a bug in ``--resolve-local-platforms`` handling that made it unusable in 2.1.16
(#1043) as well as fixing a long standing file handle leak (#1050) and a bug when running under
macOS framework builds of Python (#1009).

  `PR #1049 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1049>`_

* slightly demystify the relationship between platforms and interpreters in the library API and CLI (#1047)
  `PR #1047 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1047>`_

* Use MyPy via type comments (#1032)
  `PR #1032 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1032>`_

2.1.16
------

This release fixes a bug in sys.path scrubbing / hermeticity (#1025)
and a bug in the ``-D / --sources-directory`` and
``-R / --resources-directory`` options whereby PEP-420 implicit
(namespace) packages were not respected (#1021).

* Improve UnsatisfiableInterpreterConstraintsError. (#1028)
  `PR #1028 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1028>`_

2.1.15
------

A patch release to fix an issue with the ``--use-first-matching-interpreter`` flag.

* Fix --use-first-matching-interpreter at runtime. (#1014)
  `PR #1014 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1014>`_

2.1.14
------

This release adds the ``--use-first-matching-interpreter`` flag, which
can speed up performance when building a Pex at the expense of being
compatible with fewer interpreters at runtime.

* Add ``--use-first-matching-interpreter``. (#1008)
  `PR #1008 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1008>`_

* Autoformat with Black. (#1006)
  `PR #1006 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1006>`_

2.1.13
------

The focus of this release is better support of the ``--platform`` CLI
arg. Platforms are now better documented and can optionally be resolved
to local interpreters when possible via ``--resolve-local-platforms`` to
better support creation of multiplatform PEXes.

* Add support for resolving --platform locally. (#1000)
  `PR #1000 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/1000>`_

* Improve --platform help. (#1002)

* use relative paths within wheel cache (#979)
  `PR #979 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/979>`_

* Fix Tox not finding Python 3.8 on OSX. (#976)
  `PR #976 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/976>`_

2.1.10
------

This release focuses on the resolver API and resolution performance. Pex 2 resolving using Pip is
now at least at performance parity with Pex 1 in all studied cases and most often is 5% to 10%
faster.

As part of the resolution performance work, Pip networking configuration is now exposed via Pex CLI
options and the ``NetworkConfiguration`` API type / new ``resolver.resolve`` API parameter.

With network configuration now wired up, the ``PEX_HTTP_RETRIES`` and ``PEX_HTTP_TIMEOUT`` env var
support in Pex 1 that was never wired into Pex 2 is now dropped in favor of passing ``--retries``
and ``--timeout`` via the CLI (See: `Issue #94 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/94>`_)

* Expose Pip network configuration. (#974)
  `PR #974 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/974>`_

* Restore handling for bad wheel filenames to ``.can_add()`` (#973)
  `PR #973 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/973>`_

* Kill dead code. (#954)
  `PR #954 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/954>`_

2.1.9
-----

This release introduces the ability to copy requirements from an existing PEX into a new one.

This can greatly speed up repeatedly creating a PEX when no requirements have changed.
A build tool (such as Pants) can create a "requirements PEX" that contains just a static
set of requirements, and build a final PEX on top of that, without having to re-run pip
to resolve requirements.

* Support for copying requirements from an existing pex. (#948)
  `PR #948 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/948>`_


2.1.8
-----

This release brings enhanced performance when using the Pex CLI or API to resolve requirements and
improved performance for many PEXed applications when specifying the `--unzip` option. PEXes built
with `--unzip` will first unzip themselves into the Pex cache if not unzipped there already and
then re-execute themselves from there. This can improve startup latency. Pex itself now uses this
mode in our [PEX release](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/releases/download/v2.1.8/pex).

* Better support unzip mode PEXes. (#941)
  `PR #941 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/941>`_

* Cache pip.pex. (#937)
  `PR #937 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/937>`_

2.1.7
-----

This release brings more robust control of the Pex cache (PEX_ROOT).

The `--cache-dir` setting is deprecated in favor of build time control of the cache location with
`--pex-root` and new support for control of the cache's runtime location with `--runtime-pex-root`
is added. As in the past, the `PEX_ROOT` environment variable can still be used to control the
cache's runtime location.

Unlike in the past, the [Pex PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/releases/download/v2.1.7/pex)
we release can now also be controlled via the `PEX_ROOT` environment variable. Consult the CLI help
for `--no-strip-pex-env` to find out more.

2.1.0
-----

This release restores and improves support for building and running
multiplatform pexes. Foreign `linux*` platform builds now include
`manylinux2014` compatible wheels by default and foreign CPython pexes now
resolve `abi3` wheels correctly. In addition, error messages at both buildtime
and runtime related to resolution of dependencies are more informative.

Pex 2.1.0 should be considered the first Pex 2-series release that fully
replaces and improves upon Pex 1-series functionality.

2.0.3
-----

This release fixes a regression in handling explicitly requested `--index` or
`--find-links` http (insecure) repos. In addition, performance of the pex 2.x
resolver is brought in line with the 1.x resolver in all cases and improved in
most cases.

* Unify PEX buildtime and runtime wheel caches. #821
  `PR #821 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/821>`_

2.0.2
-----

This is a hotfix release that fixes a bug exposed when Pex was asked to use an
interpreter with a non-canonical path as well as fixes for 'current' platform
handling in the resolver API.

* Fix current platform handling. (#801)
  `PR #801 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/801>`_

* Add a test of pypi index rendering. (#799)
  `PR #799 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/799>`_

(`-i`/`--index`/`--index-url`) via the CLI.

* Fix #794 issue by add missing return statement in __str__ (#795)
  `PR #795 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/795>`_

2.0.0
-----

Pex 2.0.0 is cut on the advent of a large, mostly internal change for typical
use cases: it now uses vendored pip to perform resolves and wheel builds. This
fixes a large number of compatibility and correctness bugs as well as gaining
feature support from pip including handling manylinux2010 and manylinux2014 as
well as VCS requirements and support for PEP-517 & PEP-518 builds.

API changes to be wary of:

* The egg distribution format is no longer supported.
* The deprecated ``--interpreter-cache-dir`` CLI option was removed.
* The ``--cache-ttl`` CLI option and ``cache_ttl`` resolver API argument were
  removed.
* The resolver API replaced ``fetchers`` with a list of ``indexes`` and a list
  of ``find_links`` repos.
* The resolver API removed (http) ``context`` which is now automatically
  handled.
* The resolver API removed ``precedence`` which is now pip default precedence:
  wheels when available and not ruled out via the ``--no-wheel`` CLI option or
  ``use_wheel=False`` API argument.
* The ``--platform`` CLI option and ``platform`` resolver API argument now must
  be full platform strings that include platform, implementation, version and
  abi; e.g.: ``--platform=macosx-10.13-x86_64-cp-36-m``.
* The ``--manylinux`` CLI option and ``use_manylinux`` resolver API argument
  were removed. Instead, to resolve manylinux wheels for a foreign platform,
  specify the manylinux platform to target with an explicit ``--platform`` CLI
  flag or ``platform`` resolver API argument; e.g.:
  ``--platform=manylinux2010-x86_64-cp-36-m``.

In addition, Pex 2.0.0 now builds reproduceable pexes by default; ie:

* Python modules embedded in the pex are not pre-compiled (pass --compile if
  you want this).
* The timestamps for Pex file zip entries default to midnight on
  January 1, 1980 (pass --use-system-time to change this).

This finishes off the effort tracked by
`Issue #716 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/718>`_

Changes in this release:

* Pex defaults to reproduceable builds. (#791)
  `PR #791 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/791>`_

1.6.12
------

lists and allows for python binaries built under Gentoo naming conventions.

* Add an --intransitive option. (#775)
  `PR #775 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/775>`_

* PythonInterpreter: support python binary names with single letter suffixes (#769)
  `PR #769 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/769>`_

1.6.11
------

This release brings a consistency fix to requirement resolution and an
isolation fix that scrubs all non-stdlib PYTHONPATH entries by default,
only pre-pending or appending them to the `sys.path` if the
corresponding `--inherit-path=(prefer|fallback)` is used.

* Avoid reordering of equivalent packages from multiple fetchers (#762)
  `PR #762 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/762>`_

* Fixup import sorting. (#731)
  `PR #731 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/731>`_

1.6.7
-----

We now support reproducible builds when creating a pex via `pex -o foo.pex`, meaning that if
you were to run the command again with the same inputs, the two generated pexes would be
byte-for-byte identical. To enable reproducible builds when building a pex, use the flags
`--no-use-system-time --no-compile`, which will use a deterministic timestamp and not include
`.pyc` files in the Pex.

In Pex 1.7.0, we will default to reproducible builds.

  `PR #668 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/668>`_

1.6.3
-----

This release changes the behavior of the ``--interpreter-constraint`` option.
Previously, interpreter constraints were ANDed, which made it impossible to
express constraints like '>=2.7,<3' OR '>=3.6,<4'; ie: either python 2.7 or
else any python 3 release at or above 3.6. Now interpreter constraints are
ORed, which is likely a breaking change if you have scripts that pass multiple
interpreter constraints. To transition, use the native ``,`` AND operator in
your constraint expression, as used in the example above.

  `PR #592 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/592>`_

1.5.0
-----

This release fixes pexes such that they fully support environment markers, the canonical use case

  `#154 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/154>`_.

* Adds the ``bdist_pex`` command to setuptools.
  `#99 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/99>`_.

* Bug fix: We did not normalize package names in ``ResolvableSet``, so it was possible to depend on
  ``sphinx`` and ``Sphinx-1.4a0.tar.gz`` and get two versions build and included into the pex.
  `#147 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/147>`_.

* Adds a pex-identifying User-Agent. `#101 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/101>`_.

1.0.3
-----

* Bug fix: Accommodate OSX ``Python`` python binaries.  Previously the OSX python distributions shipped

  Fixes `#144 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/144>`_.

* Bug fix: PEX_SCRIPT failed when the script was from a not-zip-safe egg.
  Original PR `#139 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/139>`_.

  `#143 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/143>`_.

1.0.2
-----

* Bug fix: PEX-INFO values were overridden by environment ``Variables`` with default values that were
  not explicitly set in the environment.
  Fixes `#135 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/135>`_.

* Bug fix: Since `69649c1 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/commit/69649c1>`_ we have been unpatching
  the side-effects of ``sys.modules`` after ``PEX.execute``.  This takes all modules imported during
  the PEX lifecycle and sets all their attributes to ``None``.  Unfortunately, ``sys.excepthook``,
  ``atexit`` and ``__del__`` may still try to operate using these tainted modules, causing exceptions
  on interpreter teardown.  This reverts just the ``sys`` unpatching so that the abovementioned
  teardown hooks behave more predictably.
  Fixes `#141 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/141>`_.

1.0.1
-----

* Allow PEXBuilder to optionally copy files into the PEX environment instead of hard-linking them.

* Allow PEXBuilder to optionally skip precompilation of .py files into .pyc files.

  Fixes `#127 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/127>`_.

* Bug fix: Fix complex resolutions when using a cache.
  Fixes: `#120 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/120>`_.

1.0.0
-----

The 1.0.0 release of pex introduces a few breaking changes: ``pex -r`` now takes requirements.txt files
instead of requirement specs, ``pex -s`` has now been removed since source specs are accepted as arguments,
and ``pex -p`` has been removed in favor of its alias ``pex -o``.

The pex *command line interface* now adheres to semver insofar as backwards incompatible CLI
changes will invoke a major version change.  Any backwards incompatible changes to the PEX
environment variable semantics will also result in a major version change.  The pex *API* adheres
to semver insofar as backwards incompatible API changes will invoke minor version changes.

For users of the PEX API, it is recommended to add minor version ranges, e.g. ``pex>=1.0,<1.1``.
For users of the PEX CLI, major version ranges such as ``pex>=1,<2`` should be sufficient.

* BREAKING CHANGE: Removes the ``-s`` option in favor of specifying directories directly as
  arguments to the pex command line.

* BREAKING CHANGE: ``pex -r`` now takes requirements.txt filenames and *not* requirement
  specs.  Requirement specs are now passed as arguments to the pex tool.  Use ``--`` to escape
  command line arguments passed to interpreters spawned by pex.  Implements
  `#5 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/5>`_.

* Adds a number of flag aliases to be more compatible with pip command lines: ``--no-index``,
  ``-f``, ``--find-links``, ``--index-url``, ``--no-use-wheel``.  Removes ``-p`` in favor of
  ``-o`` exclusively.

* Adds ``--python-shebang`` option to the pex tool in order to set the ``#!`` shebang to an exact
  path.  `#53 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/53>`_.

* Adds support for ``PEX_PYTHON`` environment variable which will cause the pex file to reinvoke
  itself using the interpreter specified, e.g. ``PEX_PYTHON=python3.4`` or
  ``PEX_PYTHON=/exact/path/to/interpreter``.  `#27 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/27>`_.

* Adds support for ``PEX_PATH`` environment variable which allows merging of PEX environments at
  runtime.  This can be used to inject plugins or entry_points or modules from one PEX into
  another without explicitly building them together. `#30 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/30>`_.

* Consolidates documentation of ``PEX_`` environment variables and adds the ``--help-variables`` option
  to the pex client.  Partially addresses `#13 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/13>`_.

* Adds helper method to dump a package subdirectory onto disk from within a zipped PEX file.  This
  can be useful for applications that know they're running within a PEX and would prefer some
  static assets dumped to disk instead of running as an unzipped PEX file.
  `#12 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/12>`_.

* Now supports extras for static URLs and installable directories.
  `#65 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/65>`_.

* Adds ``-m`` and ``--entry-point`` alias to the existing ``-e`` option for entry points in
  the pex tool to evoke the similarity to ``python -m``.

* Adds console script support via ``-c/--script/--console-script`` and ``PEX_SCRIPT``.  This allows
  you to reference the named entry point instead of the exact ``module:name`` pair.  Also supports
  scripts defined in the ``scripts`` section of setup.py.
  `#59 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/59>`_.

* Adds more debugging information when encountering unresolvable requirements.
  `#79 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/79>`_.

* Bug fix: ``PEX_COVERAGE`` and ``PEX_PROFILE`` did not function correctly when SystemExit was raised.
  Fixes `#81 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/81>`_.

* Bug fix: Fixes caching in the PEX tool since we don't cache the source distributions of installable
  directories.  `#24 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/24>`_.

0.9.0
-----

This is the last release before the 1.0.0 development branch is started.

* Change the setuptools range to >=2.2,<16 by handling EntryPoint changes as well as
  being flexible on whether ``pkg_resources`` is a package or a module.  Fixes
  `#55 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/55>`_ and
  `#34 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/34>`_.

* Adds option groups to the pex tool to make the help output slightly more readable.

* Bug fix: Make ``pip install pex`` work better by removing ``extras_requires`` on the
  ``console_script`` entry point.  Fixes `#48 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/48>`_

* New feature: Adds an interpreter cache to the ``pex`` tool.  If the user does not explicitly
  disable the wheel feature and attempts to build a pex with wheels but does not have the wheel
  package installed, pex will download it in order to make the feature work.
  Implements `#47 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/47>`_ in order to
  fix `#48 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/48>`_

0.8.6
-----

* Bug fix: Honor installed sys.excepthook in pex teardown.
  `RB #1733 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1733>`_

* Bug fix: ``UrllibContext`` used ``replace`` as a keyword argument for ``bytes.decode``
  but this only works on Python 3.  `Pull Request #46 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/46>`_

0.8.5
-----

* Bug fix: Fixup string formatting in pex/bin/pex.py to support Python 2.6
  `Pull Request #40 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/40>`_

0.8.4
-----

* Performance improvement: Speed up the best-case scenario of dependency resolution.
  `RB #1685 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1685>`_

* Bug fix: Change from ``uuid4().get_hex()`` to ``uuid4().hex`` to maintain Python3
  compatibility of pex.common.
  `Pull Request #39 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/39>`_

* Bug fix: Actually cache the results of translation.  Previously bdist translations
  would be created in a temporary directory even if a cache location was specified.
  `RB #1666 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1666>`_

* Bug fix: Support all potential abi tag permutations when determining platform
  compatibility.
  `Pull Request #33 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/33>`_

0.8.3
-----

* Performance improvement: Don't always write packages to disk if they've already been
  cached.  This can significantly speed up launching PEX files with a large
  number of non-zip-safe dependencies.
  `RB #1642 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1642>`_

0.8.2
-----

* Bug fix: Allow pex 0.8.x to parse pex files produced by earlier versions of
  pex and twitter.common.python.

* Pin pex to setuptools prior to 9.x until we have a chance to make changes
  related to PEP440 and the change of pkg_resources.py to a package.

0.8.1
-----

* Bug fix: Fix issue where it'd be possible to ``os.path.getmtime`` on a remote ``Link`` object
  `Issue #29 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/29>`_

0.8.0
-----

* *API change*: Decouple translation from package iteration.  This removes
  the Obtainer construct entirely, which likely means if you're using PEX as
  a library, you will need to change your code if you were doing anything
  nontrivial.  This adds a couple new options to ``resolve`` but simplifies
  the story around how to cache packages.
  `RB #785 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/785/>`_

* Refactor http handling in pex to allow for alternate http implementations.  Adds support
  for `requests <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_,
  improving both performance and security.   For more information, read the commit notes at
  `91c7f32 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/commit/91c7f324085c18af714d35947b603a5f60aeb682>`_.
  `RB #778 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/778/>`_

* Improvements to API documentation throughout.

* Renamed ``Tracer`` to ``TraceLogger`` to prevent nondeterministic isort ordering.

* Refactor tox.ini to increase the number of environment combinations and improve coverage.

* Adds HTTP retry support for the RequestsContext.
  `RB #1303 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1303/>`_

* Make pex --version correct.
  `Issue #19 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/19>`_

* Bug fix: Fix over-aggressive sys.modules scrubbing for namespace packages.  Under
  certain circumstances, namespace packages in site-packages could conflict with packages
  within a PEX, causing them to fail importing.
  `RB #1378 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/1378/>`_

* Bug fix: Replace uses of ``os.unsetenv(...)`` with ``del os.environ[...]``
  `Pull Request #11 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/pull/11>`_

* Bug fix: Scrub sys.path and sys.modules based upon both supplied path and
  realpath of files and directories.  Newer versions of virtualenv on Linux symlink site-packages
  which caused those packages to not be removed from sys.path correctly.
  `Issue #21 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/21>`_

* Bug fix: The pex -s option was not correctly pulling in transitive dependencies.
  `Issue #22 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/22>`_

* Bug fix: Adds ``content`` method to HTTP contexts that does HTML content decoding, fixing
  an encoding issue only experienced when using Python 3.
  `Issue #10 <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex/issues/10>`_

0.7.0
-----

* Rename ``twitter.common.python`` to ``pex`` and split out from the
  `twitter/commons <http://github.com/twitter/commons>`_ repo.

0.6.0
-----

* Change the interpretation of ``-i`` (and of PyPIFetcher's pypi_base)
  to match pip's ``-i``.  This is useful for compatibility with devpi.

0.5.10
------

* Ensures that .egg/.whl distributions on disk have their mtime updated
  even though we no longer overwrite them. This gives them a new time
  lease against their ttl.

  Without this change, once a distribution aged past the ttl it would
  never be used again, and builds would re-create the same distributions
  in tmpdirs over and over again.

0.5.9
-----

* Fixes an issue where SourceTranslator would overwrite .egg/.whl
  distributions already on disk.  Instead it should always check to see if
  a copy already exists and reuse if there.

  This ordinarily should not be a problem but the zipimporter caches
  metadata by filename instead of stat/sha, so if the underlying contents
  changed a runtime error would be thrown due to seemingly corrupt zip file
  offsets. `RB #684 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/684/>`_

0.5.8
-----

* Adds ``-i/--index`` option to the pex tool.

0.5.7
-----

* Adds ``twitter.common.python.pex_bootstrap`` ``bootstrap_pex_env`` function in
  order to initialize a PEX environment from within a python interpreter.
  (Patch contributed by @kwlzn)

* Adds stdin=,stdout=,stderr= keyword parameters to the ``PEX.run`` function.
  (Patch from @benjy)

0.5.6
-----

* The crawler now defaults to not follow links for security reasons.
  (Before the default behavior was to implicitly ``--follow-links`` for all
  requirements.) `RB #293 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/293/>`_

0.5.5
-----

* Improves scrubbing of site-packages from PEX environments.
  `RB #289 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/289/>`_

0.5.1 - 0.5.4
-------------

* Silences exceptions reported during interpreter teardown (the exceptions
  resulting from incorrect atexit handler behavior) introduced by 0.4.3
  `RB #253 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/253/>`_
  `RB #249 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/249/>`_

* Adds ``__hash__`` to ``Link`` so that Packages are hashed correctly in
  ``twitter.common.python.resolver`` ``resolve``

0.5.0
-----

* Adds wheel support to ``twitter.common.python``
  `RB #94 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/94/>`_
  `RB #154 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/154/>`_
  `RB #148 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/148/>`_

0.4.3
-----

* Adds ``twitter.common.python.finders`` which are additional finders for
  setuptools including:
  - find eggs within a .zip
  - find wheels within a directory
  - find wheels within a .zip
  `RB #86 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/86/>`_

* Adds a new Package abstraction by refactoring Link into Link and Package.
  `RB #92 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/92/>`_

* Adds support for PEP425 tagging necessary for wheel support.
  `RB #87 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/87/>`_

* Improves python environment isolation by correctly scrubbing namespace
  packages injected into module ``__path__`` attributes by nspkg pth files.
  `RB #116 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/116/>`_

* Adds ``twitter.common.python.resolver`` ``resolve`` method that handles
  transitive dependency resolution better.  This means that if the
  requirement ``futures==2.1.2`` and an unqualified ``futures>=2`` is pulled in
  transitively, our resolver will correctly resolve futures 2.1.2 instead
  of reporting a VersionConflict if any version newer than 2.1.2 is
  available. `RB #129 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/129/>`_

* Factors all ``twitter.common.python`` test helpers into
  ``twitter.common.python.testing``
  `RB #91 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/91/>`_

* Bug fix: Fix ``OrderedSet`` atexit exceptions
  `RB #147 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/147/>`_

* Bug fix: Fix cross-device symlinking (patch from @benjy)

* Bug fix: Raise a ``RuntimeError`` if we fail to write ``pkg_resources`` into a .pex
  `RB #115 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/115/>`_

0.4.2
-----

* Upgrade to ``setuptools>=1``

0.4.1
-----

* ``twitter.common.python`` is no longer a namespace package

0.4.0
-----

* Kill the egg distiller.  We now delegate .egg generation to bdist_egg.
  `RB #55 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/55/>`_

0.3.1
-----

* Short-circuit resolving a distribution if a local exact match is found.
  `RB #47 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/47/>`_

* Correctly patch the global ``pkg_resources`` ``WorkingSet`` for the lifetime
  of the Python interpreter. `RB #52 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/52/>`_

* Fixes a performance regression in setuptools ``build_zipmanifest``
  `Setuptools Issue #154 <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/issue/154/build_zipmanifest-results-should-be>`_
  `RB #53 <https://rbcommons.com/s/twitter/r/53/>`_

0.3.0
-----

* Plumb through the ``--zip-safe``, ``--always-write-cache``, ``--ignore-errors``
  and ``--inherit-path`` flags to the pex tool.

* Delete the unused ``PythonDirWrapper`` code.

* Split ``PEXEnvironment`` resolution into ``twitter.common.python.environment``
  and deconflate ``WorkingSet``/``Environment`` state.

* Removes the monkeypatched zipimporter in favor of keeping all eggs
  unzipped within PEX files.  Refactors the PEX dependency cache in
  ``util.py``

* Adds interpreter detection for Jython and PyPy.

* Dependency translation errors should be made uniform.
  (Patch from @johnsirois)

* Adds ``PEX_PROFILE_ENTRIES`` to limit the number of entries reported when
  ``PEX_PROFILE`` is enabled. (Patch from @rgs_)

* Bug fix: Several fixes to error handling in ``twitter.common.python.http``
  (From Marc Abramowitz)

* Bug fix: PEX should not always assume that ``$PATH`` was available.
  (Patch from @jamesbroadhead)

* Bug fix: Filename should be part of the .pex cache key or else multiple
  identical versions will incorrectly resolve (Patch from @tc)

* Bug fix: Executed entry points shouldn't be forced to run in an
  environment with ``__future__`` imports enabled. (Patch from
  @lawson_patrick)

* Bug fix: Detect versionless egg links and fail fast. (Patch from
  @johnsirois.)

* Bug fix: Handle setuptools>=2.1 correctly in the zipimport monkeypatch
  (Patch from @johnsirois.)

0.2.3
-----

* Bug fix: Fix handling of Fetchers with ``file://`` urls.

0.2.2
-----

* Adds the pex tool as a standalone tool.

0.2.1
-----

* Bug fix: Bootstrapped ``twitter.common.python`` should declare ``twitter.common``
  as a namespace package.

0.2.0
-----

* Make ``twitter.common.python`` fully standalone by consolidating
  external dependencies within ``twitter.common.python.common``.

0.1.0
-----

* Initial published version of ``twitter.common.python``.

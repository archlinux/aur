# Default None, defers to maxSize in global, otherwise,
# files larger than this size (in MB) will not be downloaded
# only applies to the specific thread
# if set to 0, means no maximum and overrides global option
maxSize = 2048

# like maxSize, only file smaller than this will not be downloaded

# if you do not know what regular expressions are, stop now, do not pass go,
# do not collect USD200 (CAN195)
# google "regular expressions tutorial" and find one that suits your needs
# one with an emphasis on Python may be to your advantage

# Now, without any of the download<x> or regEx options (detailed below)
# every item in the rss feed will be downloaded,
# provided that it has not previously been downloaded
# all the regular expression should be specified in lower case
# (except for character classes and other special regular expression characters,
#  if you know what that means)
# as the string that it is searched against is set to lower case.
# Starting with regExTrue (RET)
# let's say we want to make sure there are two numbers,
# separated by something not a number
# for everything we download in this thread.
regExTrue = \d[^\d]+\d
# the default value, None, makes RET ignored
# regExTrue = None

# but we want to make sure we don't get anything with nrg or ccd in the name
# because those are undesirable formats, but we want to make sure to not match
# a name that may have those as a substring e.g. enrgy
# (ok, not a great example, come up with something better and I'll include it)
# REF from now on (# indicates a word boundary)
regExFalse = (\\bnrg\\b|\\bccd\\b)
# the default value, which means it will be ignored
# regExFalse = None

# at this point, as long as the file gets a positive hit in RET
# and no hit in REF, the file will be downloaded
# equivalently said, RET and REF are necessary and sufficient conditions.
# lengthy expressions can be constructed
# to deal with every combination of things you want, but there is
# a looping facility to allow us to get more fine grained control
#  over the items we want to grab without having to have hundreds
# of characters on a single line, which of course gets rather unreadable

# making use of this looping facility makes RET and REF neccessary
# (though that can be bypassed too, more later) conditions
# however, they are no longer sufficient....
# download<x> is like regExTrue, but begins the definition of an 'item' and
# we can associate further actions with it if we so choose
# put a non-negative integer where <x> goes
download1 = ubuntu
# but say we love ubuntu, and want to always grab everything that mentions it
# so we want to ignore regExTrue, this 'bypasses' RET when set to False.
# Default True.
download1True = False

# we could also bypass REF. but we really don't like nrg,
# but we'll deal with ccd's, just for ubuntu
# to be clear, download<x>False is a mixed type option,
# taking both True, False for dealing with the global REF
# or a string (like here) to specify what amounts to a 'localized REF',
# which effectively says False to the global REF
# while at the same time specifying the local REF
download1False = \\bnrg\\b

# with %()s interpolation, we can effectively add on to REF in a basic manner
# say for Ubuntu, we don't want want the 'hoary version,
download1False = hoary.*%(regExFalse)s
# this will insert the value for regExFalse in place of the %()s expression
# resulting in: hoarsy.*(#nrg#|#ccd#)
# note the parantheses are there b/c they are in the original REF

# we don't want to download things like howto, md5 files, etc,
# so we can set a minSize (MB)
# this overrides the global/thread minSize when not set to None
# Default None. works like thread-based minSize.
# a maxSize option is also available
download1MinSize = 10
download1MaxSize = 750

# and finally, we can put our ubuntu stuff in a special folder, if we choose
download1Dir = /home/user/ubuntustuff

# note that the numbers are not important
# as long as the options correspond to each other
# there is no download2, and that is ok.
download3 = fedora

# you have to have the base setting to have the other options
# this will not work b/c download4 is not specified
# download4Dir = /home/user/something

  details) on Linux.
  It is now possible to optionally integrate PeaZip in Windows 11 mini-context menu from
  .reg scripts in (peazip)/res/share/batch folder.

* Thu Dec 16 2021 Vladimir Svyatski <vsvyatski@yandex.ru> - 8.4.0-1
  PeaZip 8.4.0 is the first release providing experimental native packages for Darwin/macOS
  platform, built for aarch64 M1 Apple Silicon SoC, and Intel x86_64.
  This release brings fixes, improvements in management of temporary files, option to stop
  test batches only if errors are detected, and new language selection control.
  A new alternative benchmark is available, based on integer and floating point arithmetic,
  testing single core and multi core performances.
  PeaZip now comes with updated backends: Pea 1.05, and 7z 21.06, which are now employed on
  all platforms.
  On Linux, 7z backend replaces p7zip, which is still fully supported as alternative.
  New peazip-x.y.z.pack package is meant to help developers to create packages of PeaZip
  for various package management systems (e.g. DEB, RPM), containing packages' directories
  from last build.
  It does not replaces or duplicates the function of sources package peazip-x.y.z.src, as
  it is simply meant to help packaging the application for a specific distribution system,
  rather than compiling and building the binaries of the application.

  command line usage, management of preferred checksum/hash algorithms list and
  management of temporary work files.
  The release is focused on improving the support for Linux, and to make easier to
  port or package the application in environments, mandating a precise filesystem
  hierarchy structure, separating architecture-dependent binary resources from other
  types of resources, packaged with the application.
  Full list of changes and fixes is available at https://peazip.github.io/changelog.html

  PeaZip 8.2.0 is focused on improving the use from command line and scripts, and
  introduces the (peazip)/res/batch folder, which contains sample scripts and system
  integration files for both Linux and Windows (the SendTo and freedesktop_integration
  folders are moved there).
  The archive manager is now capable of optionally displaying compression/encryption
  method and modified, created, accessed timestamps for each item in the archive, and
  displaying the number of items, contained in each folder.
  It is now possible to choose to keep extracted files even in the case errors occurred
  during the extraction; working with spanned files was improved.
  "Smart extraction" is now available as a default action to take at program's startup,
  alongside "Open", "Open as archive", "Extract (full)", "Extract here".
  This release also improves the user experience on Linux systems by improving the
  automatic configuration of applications for the "open with" actions and by displaying
  more system paths in the file manager.
  The application is now installed in /opt/peazip.
  The backend was updated to Brotli 1.0.9 (Linux).
  A total of 225 file extensions can now be managed by PeaZip, with addition of .apkm,
  .apks and .aab Android package formats, and of Lzip .lz (supported on Linux versions
  only).

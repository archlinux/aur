mlat-client (0.2.13) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for Python 3.11 PyFloat_Unpack4 API change
  * Move the CLI scripts {fa-,}mlat-client into their respective packages;
    replace the existing scripts with setuptools APIs
  * Add a pyproject.toml with most of the build metadata. setup.py is still needed
    for building with older Python and for the extension module.
  * Switch package builds to use pybuild, since everything should be recent enough
    for that now.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Fri, 15 Jul 2016 13:13:03 +0100

    in two places.
  * fa-mlat-client: explicitly log exceptions on exit to try to fix cxfreeze
    weirdness.
  * fa-mlat-client: log server status messages.
  * fa-mlat-client: periodically report UDP stats so the server can notice
    message loss.

mlat-client (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Produce integer speed/heading/vrate values in Basestation output, maybe
    this will make VRS happier.

mlat-client (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Big overhaul of option handling. Existing configs should be upgraded
    automatically. See new config questions or mlat-client --help for details.

  * Support both listen and connect ("push") modes for result connections.

  * Add Beast-format result connections that generate synthetic DF17 messages
    for result position and velocity. The synthetic messages have a special
    timestamps (FF 00 MLAT) to indicate they are mlat-generated. mlat-client
    will ignore any messages with this timestamp that it receives. Input
    messages from the receiver are _not_ looped through to result connections.

  * Support receiving mlat results via a Flightaware-style connections in
    fa-mlat-client.

  * Support the full range of input / result options in fa-mlat-client.

mlat-client (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add Breaks/Replaces for piaware versions that also provide
    /usr/bin/fa-mlat-client (piaware 2.0-5 stops providing this)

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Sun, 28 Jun 2015 12:05:22 +0100

mlat-client (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Integrate the Flightaware version of the client into the main release.

  * Handle keepalives and other messages that have a timestamp of zero.
  * Log a better explanation when a ClockResetError is seen.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Mon, 15 Jun 2015 20:17:11 +0100

mlat-client (0.1.16) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Workaround for dump1090-mutability issue #47 (a bug when using --modeac that would
    trigger ClockResetErrors)

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Mon, 08 Jun 2015 17:13:03 +0100

mlat-client (0.1.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix "TypeError: expected an object with the buffer interface" and
    timestamp problems when configured for a SBS receiver.
  * Added some debugging info to ClockResetError.

mlat-client (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix looping "_modes.ClockResetError" errors after dump1090 restart.
  * Skip 0.1.13 since the 0.1.12 release had the wrong client version
    embedded in the code.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Sun, 31 May 2015 14:04:28 +0100

mlat-client (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Log client version on startup.
  * Add an inactivity timeout to server connections.
    In particular, this should help with connections that silently die
    during the handshaking phase, where we would otherwise wait forever
    without writing.
  * Convert to Python 3.
  * Use time.monotonic() if available; emulate it if not available. This should
    help with cases where system time goes backwards.
  * More processing moved into the extension module. This seems to reduce the
    client CPU by around 20% overall.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Wed, 27 May 2015 14:28:16 +0100

  * Don't explode if there is no covariance matrix in an ECEF result.
  * Log server message parsing failures with a bit more detail.
  * Fix server->client decompression in zlib2 when a partial packet is received.

mlat-client (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Remove --byteswap-timestamp option: the timestamps generated by a
    big-endian dump1090 are irretrievably broken.
  * Futureproofing: add support for "split sync" sync message
  * Futureproofing: add a sequence number to the UDP header, bump UDP version
  * Futureproofing: restructure the heartbeat message so more fields can be
    added later
  * Add support for ECEF-style return results.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Thu, 23 Apr 2015 00:10:45 +0100

  * Add --byteswap-timestamp for dealing with dump1090s that (incorrectly)
    generate little-endian timestamp values.
  * Use the normal reconnect delay when reconnecting after a timestamp problem is
    seen.
  * Don't forward DF17 sync messages with NUC<6.
  * Use UDP transport for mlat/sync messages if requested by the server. Can
    be disabled with --no-udp.
  * Send ADS-B position rate reports if requested by the server.

 -- Oliver Jowett <oliver@mutability.co.uk>  Sat, 18 Apr 2015 09:31:50 +0100

mlat-client (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * If message timestamps go significantly backwards, drop the input connection
    and reconnect.
  * Ignore heartbeat messages with a zero timestamp.
  * Expire all current aircraft state if the input connetion is lost.
  * Handle connection errors a bit more reliably.

.SH NAME
.PP
gocryptfs \- mount an encrypted directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS Initialize encrypted filesystem
.PP
gocryptfs \-init [OPTIONS] CIPHERDIR
.SS Mount
.PP
gocryptfs [OPTIONS] CIPHERDIR MOUNTPOINT \-o
COMMA\-SEPARATED\-OPTIONS (#o-comma-separated-options)
.SS Change password
.PP
gocryptfs \-passwd [OPTIONS] CIPHERDIR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Available options are listed below.
.SS \-aessiv
.PP
Use the AES\-SIV encryption mode.
This is slower than GCM but is secure with deterministic nonces as used
in "\-reverse" mode.
.SS \-allow_other
.PP
By default, the Linux kernel prevents any other user (even root) to
access a mounted FUSE filesystem.
Settings this option allows access for other users, subject to file
permission checking.
Only works if user_allow_other is set in /etc/fuse.conf.
This option is equivalent to "allow_other" plus "default_permissions"
described in fuse(8).
.SS \-config string
.PP
Use specified config file instead of CIPHERDIR/gocryptfs.conf
.SS \-cpuprofile string
.PP
Write cpu profile to specified file
.SS \-ctlsock string
.PP
Create a control socket at the specified location.
The socket can be used to decrypt and encrypt paths inside the
filesystem.
When using this option, make sure that the direcory you place the socket
in is not world\-accessible.
For example, \f[C]/run/user/UID/my.socket\f[] would be suitable.
.SS \-d, \-debug
.PP
Enable debug output
.SS \-extpass string
.PP
Use an external program (like ssh\-askpass) for the password prompt.
The program should return the password on stdout, a trailing newline is
stripped by gocryptfs.
Using something like "cat /mypassword.txt" allows to mount the gocryptfs
filesytem without user interaction.
.SS \-fg, \-f
.PP
Stay in the foreground instead of forking away.
Implies "\-nosyslog".
For compatability, "\-f" is also accepted, but "\-fg" is preferred.
.SS \-force_owner string
.PP
If given a string of the form "uid:gid" (where both "uid" and "gid" are
substituted with positive integers), presents all files as owned by the
given uid and gid, regardless of their actual ownership.
Implies "allow_other".
.PP
This is rarely desired behavior: One should \f[I]usually\f[] run
gocryptfs as the account which owns the backing\-store files, which
should \f[I]usually\f[] be one and the same with the account intended to
access the decrypted content.
An example of a case where this may be useful is a situation where
content is stored on a filesystem that doesn\[aq]t properly support UNIX
ownership and permissions.
.SS \-forcedecode
.PP
Force decode of encrypted files even if the integrity check fails,
instead of failing with an IO error.
Warning messages are still printed to syslog if corrupted files are
encountered.
It can be useful to recover files from disks with bad sectors or other
corrupted media.
It shall not be used if the origin of corruption is unknown, specially
if you want to run executable files.
.PP
For corrupted media, note that you probably want to use dd_rescue(1)
instead, which will recover all but the corrupted 4kB block.
.PP
This option makes no sense in reverse mode.
It requires gocryptfs to be compiled with openssl support and implies
\-openssl true.
Because of this, it is not compatible with \-aessiv, that uses built\-in
Go crypto.
.PP
Setting this option forces the filesystem to read\-only and noexec.
.SS \-fsname string
.PP
Override the filesystem name (first column in df \-T).
Can also be passed as "\-o fsname=" and is equivalent to libfuse\[aq]s
option of the same name.
By default, CIPHERDIR is used.
.SS \-fusedebug
.PP
Enable fuse library debug output
.SS \-h, \-help
.PP
Print a short help text that shows the more\-often used options.
.SS \-hh
.PP
Long help text, shows all available options.
.SS \-hkdf
.PP
Use HKDF to derive separate keys for content and name encryption from
the master key.
.SS \-info
.PP
Pretty\-print the contents of the config file for human consumption,
stripping out sensitive data.
.SS \-init
.PP
Initialize encrypted directory
.SS \-ko
.PP
Pass additonal mount options to the kernel (comma\-separated list).
FUSE filesystems are mounted with "nodev,nosuid" by default.
If gocryptfs runs as root, you can enable device files by passing the
opposite mount option, "dev", and if you want to enable suid\-binaries,
pass "suid".
"ro" (equivalent to passing the "\-ro" option) and "noexec" may also be
interesting.
For a complete list see the section
\f[C]FILESYSTEM\-INDEPENDENT\ MOUNT\ OPTIONS\f[] in mount(8).
.SS \-longnames
.PP
Store names longer than 176 bytes in extra files (default true) This
flag is useful when recovering old gocryptfs filesystems using
"\-masterkey".
It is ignored (stays at the default) otherwise.
.SS \-masterkey string
.PP
Use a explicit master key specified on the command line.
This option can be used to mount a gocryptfs filesystem without a config
file.
Note that the command line, and with it the master key, is visible to
anybody on the machine who can execute "ps \-auxwww".
This is meant as a recovery option for emergencies, such as if you have
forgotten your password.
.PP
Example master key:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
6f717d8b\-6b5f8e8a\-fd0aa206\-778ec093\-62c5669b\-abd229cd\-241e00cd\-b4d6713d
.SS \-memprofile string
.PP
Write memory profile to the specified file.
This is useful when debugging memory usage of gocryptfs.
.SS \-nonempty
.PP
Allow mounting over non\-empty directories.
FUSE by default disallows this to prevent accidential shadowing of
files.
.SS \-noprealloc
.PP
Disable preallocation before writing.
By default, gocryptfs preallocates the space the next write will take
using fallocate(2) in mode FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE.
The preallocation makes sure it cannot run out of space in the middle of
the write, which would cause the last 4kB block to be corrupt and
unreadable.
.PP
On ext4, preallocation is fast and does not cause a noticeable
performance hit.
Unfortunately, on Btrfs, preallocation is very slow, especially on
rotational HDDs.
The "\-noprealloc" option gives users the choice to trade robustness
against out\-of\-space errors for a massive speedup.
.PP
For benchmarks and more details of the issue see
https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/63 .
.SS \-nosyslog
.PP
Diagnostic messages are normally redirected to syslog once gocryptfs
daemonizes.
This option disables the redirection and messages will continue be
printed to stdout and stderr.
.SS \-notifypid int
.PP
Send USR1 to the specified process after successful mount.
This is used internally for daemonization.
.SS \-o COMMA\-SEPARATED\-OPTIONS
.PP
For compatibility with mount(1), options are also accepted as "\-o
COMMA\-SEPARATED\-OPTIONS" at the end of the command line.
For example, "\-o q,zerokey" is equivalent to passing "\-q \-zerokey".
.SS \-openssl bool/"auto"
.PP
Use OpenSSL instead of built\-in Go crypto (default "auto").
Using built\-in crypto is 4x slower unless your CPU has AES instructions
and you are using Go 1.6+.
In mode "auto", gocrypts chooses the faster option.
.SS \-passfile string
.PP
Read password from the specified file.
This is a shortcut for specifying \[aq]\-extpass="/bin/cat \-\-
FILE"\[aq].
.SS \-passwd
.PP
Change the password.
Will ask for the old password, check if it is correct, and ask for a new
one.
.PP
This can be used together with \f[C]\-masterkey\f[] if you forgot the
password but know the master key.
Note that without the old password, gocryptfs cannot tell if the master
key is correct and will overwrite the old one without mercy.
It will, however, create a backup copy of the old config file as
\f[C]gocryptfs.conf.bak\f[].
Delete it after you have verified that you can access your files with
the new password.
.SS \-plaintextnames
.PP
Do not encrypt file names and symlink targets
.SS \-q, \-quiet
.PP
Quiet \- silence informational messages
.SS \-raw64
.PP
Use unpadded base64 encoding for file names.
This gets rid of the trailing "\\=\\=".
A filesystem created with this option can only be mounted using
gocryptfs v1.2 and higher.
.SS \-reverse
.PP
Reverse mode shows a read\-only encrypted view of a plaintext directory.
Implies "\-aessiv".
.SS \-ro
.PP
Mount the filesystem read\-only
.SS \-scryptn int
.PP
scrypt cost parameter expressed as scryptn=log2(N).
Possible values are 10 to 28, representing N=2^10 to N=2^28.
.PP
Setting this to a lower value speeds up mounting and reduces its memory
needs, but makes the password susceptible to brute\-force attacks.
The default is 16.
.SS \-serialize_reads
.PP
The kernel usually submits multiple concurrent reads to service
userspace requests and kernel readahead.
gocryptfs serves them concurrently and in arbitrary order.
On backing storage that performs poorly for concurrent or out\-of\-order
reads (like Amazon Cloud Drive), this behavoir can cause very slow read
speeds.
.PP
The \f[C]\-serialize_reads\f[] option does two things: (1) reads will be
submitted one\-by\-one (no concurrency) and (2) gocryptfs tries to order
the reads by file offset order.
.PP
The ordering requires gocryptfs to wait a certain time before submitting
a read.
The serialization introduces extra locking.
These factors will limit throughput to below 70MB/s.
.PP
For more details visit https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/92 .
.SS \-speed
.PP
Run crypto speed test.
Benchmark Go\[aq]s built\-in GCM against OpenSSL (if available).
The library that will be selected on "\-openssl=auto" (the default) is
marked as such.
.SS \-trace string
.PP
Write execution trace to file.
View the trace using "go tool trace FILE".
.SS \-version
.PP
Print version and exit.
The output contains three fields seperated by ";".
Example: "gocryptfs v1.1.1\-5\-g75b776c; go\-fuse 6b801d3; 2016\-11\-01
go1.7.3".
Field 1 is the gocryptfs version, field 2 is the version of the go\-fuse
library, field 3 is the compile date and the Go version that was used.
.SS \-wpanic
.PP
When encountering a warning, panic and exit immediately.
This is useful in regression testing.
.SS \-zerokey
.PP
Use all\-zero dummy master key.
This options is only intended for automated testing as it does not
provide any security.
.SS \-\-
.PP
Stop option parsing.
Helpful when CIPHERDIR may start with a dash "\-".

.SH NAME
.PP
gocryptfs \- create or mount an encrypted filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SS Initialize encrypted filesystem
.PP
\f[C]gocryptfs\ \-init\ [OPTIONS]\ CIPHERDIR\f[]
.SS Mount
.PP
\f[C]gocryptfs\ [OPTIONS]\ CIPHERDIR\ MOUNTPOINT\ [\-o\ COMMA\-SEPARATED\-OPTIONS]\f[]
.SS Change password
.PP
\f[C]gocryptfs\ \-passwd\ [OPTIONS]\ CIPHERDIR\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Available options are listed below.
.SS \-aessiv
.PP
Use the AES\-SIV encryption mode.
This is slower than GCM but is secure with deterministic nonces as used
in \[lq]\-reverse\[rq] mode.
.SS \-allow_other
.PP
By default, the Linux kernel prevents any other user (even root) to
access a mounted FUSE filesystem.
Settings this option allows access for other users, subject to file
permission checking.
Only works if user_allow_other is set in /etc/fuse.conf.
This option is equivalent to \[lq]allow_other\[rq] plus
\[lq]default_permissions\[rq] described in fuse(8).
.SS \-config string
.PP
Use specified config file instead of \f[C]CIPHERDIR/gocryptfs.conf\f[].
.SS \-cpuprofile string
.PP
Write cpu profile to specified file.
.SS \-ctlsock string
.PP
Create a control socket at the specified location.
The socket can be used to decrypt and encrypt paths inside the
filesystem.
When using this option, make sure that the directory you place the
socket in is not world\-accessible.
For example, \f[C]/run/user/UID/my.socket\f[] would be suitable.
.SS \-d, \-debug
.PP
Enable debug output.
.SS \-devrandom
.PP
Use /dev/random for generating the master key instead of the default Go
implementation.
This is especially useful on embedded systems with Go versions prior to
1.9, which fall back to weak random data when the getrandom syscall is
blocking.
Using this option can block indefinitely when the kernel cannot harvest
enough entropy.
.SS \-extpass string
.PP
Use an external program (like ssh\-askpass) for the password prompt.
The program should return the password on stdout, a trailing newline is
stripped by gocryptfs.
Using something like \[lq]cat /mypassword.txt\[rq] allows one to mount
the gocryptfs filesystem without user interaction.
.SS \-fg, \-f
.PP
Stay in the foreground instead of forking away.
Implies \[lq]\-nosyslog\[rq].
For compatibility, \[lq]\-f\[rq] is also accepted, but \[lq]\-fg\[rq] is
preferred.
.SS \-force_owner string
.PP
If given a string of the form \[lq]uid:gid\[rq] (where both
\[lq]uid\[rq] and \[lq]gid\[rq] are substituted with positive integers),
presents all files as owned by the given uid and gid, regardless of
their actual ownership.
Implies \[lq]allow_other\[rq].
.PP
This is rarely desired behavior: One should \f[I]usually\f[] run
gocryptfs as the account which owns the backing\-store files, which
should \f[I]usually\f[] be one and the same with the account intended to
access the decrypted content.
An example of a case where this may be useful is a situation where
content is stored on a filesystem that doesn't properly support UNIX
ownership and permissions.
.SS \-forcedecode
.PP
Force decode of encrypted files even if the integrity check fails,
instead of failing with an IO error.
Warning messages are still printed to syslog if corrupted files are
encountered.
It can be useful to recover files from disks with bad sectors or other
corrupted media.
It shall not be used if the origin of corruption is unknown, specially
if you want to run executable files.
.PP
For corrupted media, note that you probably want to use dd_rescue(1)
instead, which will recover all but the corrupted 4kB block.
.PP
This option makes no sense in reverse mode.
It requires gocryptfs to be compiled with openssl support and implies
\-openssl true.
Because of this, it is not compatible with \-aessiv, that uses built\-in
Go crypto.
.PP
Setting this option forces the filesystem to read\-only and noexec.
.SS \-fsname string
.PP
Override the filesystem name (first column in df \-T).
Can also be passed as \[lq]\-o fsname=\[rq] and is equivalent to
libfuse's option of the same name.
By default, CIPHERDIR is used.
.SS \-fusedebug
.PP
Enable fuse library debug output.
.SS \-h, \-help
.PP
Print a short help text that shows the more\-often used options.
.SS \-hh
.PP
Long help text, shows all available options.
.SS \-hkdf
.PP
Use HKDF to derive separate keys for content and name encryption from
the master key.
.SS \-info
.PP
Pretty\-print the contents of the config file for human consumption,
stripping out sensitive data.
.SS \-init
.PP
Initialize encrypted directory.
.SS \-ko
.PP
Pass additional mount options to the kernel (comma\-separated list).
FUSE filesystems are mounted with \[lq]nodev,nosuid\[rq] by default.
If gocryptfs runs as root, you can enable device files by passing the
opposite mount option, \[lq]dev\[rq], and if you want to enable
suid\-binaries, pass \[lq]suid\[rq].
\[lq]ro\[rq] (equivalent to passing the \[lq]\-ro\[rq] option) and
\[lq]noexec\[rq] may also be interesting.
For a complete list see the section
\f[C]FILESYSTEM\-INDEPENDENT\ MOUNT\ OPTIONS\f[] in mount(8).
On MacOS, \[lq]local\[rq], \[lq]noapplexattr\[rq],
\[lq]noappledouble\[rq] may be interesting.
.PP
Note that unlike \[lq]\-o\[rq], \[lq]\-ko\[rq] is a regular option and
must be passed BEFORE the directories.
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
gocryptfs\ \-ko\ noexec\ /tmp/foo\ /tmp/bar
\f[]
.fi
.SS \-longnames
.PP
Store names longer than 176 bytes in extra files (default true) This
flag is useful when recovering old gocryptfs filesystems using
\[lq]\-masterkey\[rq].
It is ignored (stays at the default) otherwise.
.SS \-masterkey string
.PP
Use a explicit master key specified on the command line.
This option can be used to mount a gocryptfs filesystem without a config
file.
Note that the command line, and with it the master key, is visible to
anybody on the machine who can execute \[lq]ps \-auxwww\[rq].
This is meant as a recovery option for emergencies, such as if you have
forgotten the password or lost the config file.
.PP
Even if a config file exists, it will not be used.
All non\-standard settings have to be passed on the command line:
\f[C]\-aessiv\f[] when you mount a filesystem that was created using
reverse mode, or \f[C]\-plaintextnames\f[] for a filesystem that was
created with that option.
.PP
Example master key:
.PD 0
.P
.PD
6f717d8b\-6b5f8e8a\-fd0aa206\-778ec093\-62c5669b\-abd229cd\-241e00cd\-b4d6713d
.SS \-memprofile string
.PP
Write memory profile to the specified file.
This is useful when debugging memory usage of gocryptfs.
.SS \-nonempty
.PP
Allow mounting over non\-empty directories.
FUSE by default disallows this to prevent accidental shadowing of files.
.SS \-noprealloc
.PP
Disable preallocation before writing.
By default, gocryptfs preallocates the space the next write will take
using fallocate(2) in mode FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE.
The preallocation makes sure it cannot run out of space in the middle of
the write, which would cause the last 4kB block to be corrupt and
unreadable.
.PP
On ext4, preallocation is fast and does not cause a noticeable
performance hit.
Unfortunately, on Btrfs, preallocation is very slow, especially on
rotational HDDs.
The \[lq]\-noprealloc\[rq] option gives users the choice to trade
robustness against out\-of\-space errors for a massive speedup.
.PP
For benchmarks and more details of the issue see
https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/63 .
.SS \-nosyslog
.PP
Diagnostic messages are normally redirected to syslog once gocryptfs
daemonizes.
This option disables the redirection and messages will continue be
printed to stdout and stderr.
.SS \-notifypid int
.PP
Send USR1 to the specified process after successful mount.
This is used internally for daemonization.
.SS \-o COMMA\-SEPARATED\-OPTIONS
.PP
For compatibility with mount(1), options are also accepted as \[lq]\-o
COMMA\-SEPARATED\-OPTIONS\[rq] at the end of the command line.
For example, \[lq]\-o q,zerokey\[rq] is equivalent to passing \[lq]\-q
\-zerokey\[rq].
.PP
Note that you can only use options that are understood by gocryptfs with
\[lq]\-o\[rq].
If you want to pass special flags to the kernel, you should use
\[lq]\-ko\[rq] (\f[I]k\f[]ernel \f[I]o\f[]ption).
This is different in libfuse\-based filesystems, that automatically pass
any \[lq]\-o\[rq] options they do not understand along to the kernel.
.PP
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
gocryptfs\ /tmp/foo\ /tmp/bar\ \-o\ q,zerokey
\f[]
.fi
.SS \-openssl bool/\[lq]auto\[rq]
.PP
Use OpenSSL instead of built\-in Go crypto (default \[lq]auto\[rq]).
Using built\-in crypto is 4x slower unless your CPU has AES instructions
and you are using Go 1.6+.
In mode \[lq]auto\[rq], gocrypts chooses the faster option.
.SS \-passfile string/
.PP
Read password from the specified file.
This is a shortcut for specifying `\-extpass=\[lq]/bin/cat \[en]
FILE\[rq]'.
.SS \-passwd
.PP
Change the password.
Will ask for the old password, check if it is correct, and ask for a new
one.
.PP
This can be used together with \f[C]\-masterkey\f[] if you forgot the
password but know the master key.
Note that without the old password, gocryptfs cannot tell if the master
key is correct and will overwrite the old one without mercy.
It will, however, create a backup copy of the old config file as
\f[C]gocryptfs.conf.bak\f[].
Delete it after you have verified that you can access your files with
the new password.
.SS \-plaintextnames
.PP
Do not encrypt file names and symlink targets.
.SS \-q, \-quiet
.PP
Quiet \- silence informational messages.
.SS \-raw64
.PP
Use unpadded base64 encoding for file names.
This gets rid of the trailing \[lq]\\=\\=\[rq].
A filesystem created with this option can only be mounted using
gocryptfs v1.2 and higher.
.SS \-reverse
.PP
Reverse mode shows a read\-only encrypted view of a plaintext directory.
Implies \[lq]\-aessiv\[rq].
.SS \-ro
.PP
Mount the filesystem read\-only.
.SS \-scryptn int
.PP
scrypt cost parameter expressed as scryptn=log2(N).
Possible values are 10 to 28, representing N=2^10 to N=2^28.
.PP
Setting this to a lower value speeds up mounting and reduces its memory
needs, but makes the password susceptible to brute\-force attacks.
The default is 16.
.SS \-serialize_reads
.PP
The kernel usually submits multiple concurrent reads to service
userspace requests and kernel readahead.
gocryptfs serves them concurrently and in arbitrary order.
On backing storage that performs poorly for concurrent or out\-of\-order
reads (like Amazon Cloud Drive), this behavior can cause very slow read
speeds.
.PP
The \f[C]\-serialize_reads\f[] option does two things: (1) reads will be
submitted one\-by\-one (no concurrency) and (2) gocryptfs tries to order
the reads by file offset order.
.PP
The ordering requires gocryptfs to wait a certain time before submitting
a read.
The serialization introduces extra locking.
These factors will limit throughput to below 70MB/s.
.PP

.SS \-sharedstorage
.PP
Enable work\-arounds so gocryptfs works better when the backing storage
directory is concurrently accessed by multiple gocryptfs instances.
.PP
At the moment, it does two things:
.IP "1." 3
Disable stat() caching so changes to the backing storage show up
immediately.
.IP "2." 3
Disable hard link tracking, as the inode numbers on the backing storage
are not stable when files are deleted and re\-created behind our back.
This would otherwise produce strange \[lq]file does not exist\[rq] and
other errors.
.PP
When \[lq]\-sharedstorage\[rq] is active, performance is reduced and
hard links cannot be created.
.PP
Even with this flag set, you may hit occasional problems.
Running gocryptfs on shared storage does not receive as much testing as
the usual (exclusive) use\-case.
Please test your workload in advance and report any problems you may
hit.
.PP
More info: https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs/issues/156
.SS \-speed
.PP
Run crypto speed test.
Benchmark Go's built\-in GCM against OpenSSL (if available).
The library that will be selected on \[lq]\-openssl=auto\[rq] (the
default) is marked as such.
.SS \-trace string
.PP
Write execution trace to file.
View the trace using \[lq]go tool trace FILE\[rq].
.SS \-version
.PP
Print version and exit.
The output contains three fields separated by \[lq];\[rq].
Example: \[lq]gocryptfs v1.1.1\-5\-g75b776c; go\-fuse 6b801d3;
2016\-11\-01 go1.7.3\[rq].
Field 1 is the gocryptfs version, field 2 is the version of the go\-fuse
library, field 3 is the compile date and the Go version that was used.
.SS \-wpanic
.PP
When encountering a warning, panic and exit immediately.
This is useful in regression testing.
.SS \-zerokey
.PP
Use all\-zero dummy master key.
This options is only intended for automated testing as it does not
provide any security.
.SS \[en]
.PP
Stop option parsing.
Helpful when CIPHERDIR may start with a dash \[lq]\-\[rq].

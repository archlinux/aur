### Added

* added 'stats' that serves to centralise a bunch of numbers used internally that might be interesting to the user.
    - see the `more stats` button in the bottom left corner.
* Github rate limit information is now fetched as part of the stats.
    - but no more than once a minute.
    - see: https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox#user-content-github-api-authentication
* manually refreshing the user catalogue will now switch to the `log` pane before doing so.
    - the intent is to show that *something* is happening.
    - see: `Catalogue -> Refresh user catalogue`
* new (opt-in) preference to automaticaly refresh the user-catalogue every 28 days.
    - the user-catalogue are addons added to strongbox using `File -> Import addon` or by 'starring' a regular addon.
    - see: `Preferences -> Keep user catalogue updated`.
* added a "clear" button to the addons search that removes all search filters, including search terms.
* added new column for installed addons "starred" that will add an installed addon to the 'user-catalogue'.
    - star button disabled when addon is being ignored or isn't matched against the catalogue.
* new column for installed addons "size" with the total size of the addon on disk, including any grouped addons.
    - see: `View -> Columns -> size`
* `user.clj`, where the REPL will take you by default during development.
    - this lets me separate some development dependencies and logic from what is released.

### Changed

* the main window is now always split with the bottom pane hidden by default.
    - if can be dragged open or toggled open by either of the two status bar buttons.
* clicking the status bar buttons to open the bottom pane is now much quicker.
* refreshing the user-catalogue now checks imported/starred addons against the full catalogue before checking online.
    - if it fails to find addon in catalogue, it will fall back to checking online like before.
    - the user-catalogue was originally for imported addons without a catalogue (github, gitlab) but is now also for 'starred' addons. Refreshing it now that we have a Github catalogue is much faster.
* menu labels for the installed addons table columns have been tweaked (see `View -> Columns`)
    - "installed" is now "installed version"
    - "available" is now "available version"
    - "version" is now "installed+available version"
    - "WoW" is now "game version (WoW)"
* the "fat" column profile now uses the "installed" and "available" columns rather than the combined "version" column.
* the "fat" column profile includes the new "starred" and "size" columns.
    - see: `View -> Columns -> fat`
* `jlink compress=2` changed to `jlink compress=1` during the building of the linux AppImage.
    - `2` means "zip", which interferes with the final AppImage compression.
    - this shaves off ~7MB from the final AppImage.
* replaced the compressed, static, "emergency" catalogue with a simple JSON string.
    1. it wasn't working at compile time like I thought.
    2. regular strings are more compressible ultimately when building an AppImage.
* bumped dependencies.
    - removed `apache.commons.compressors` as no longer required.
* some dependencies used for development are no longer bundled during release.
* strongbox release data will only be downloaded once the app has finished loading.
* strongbox release data will only be downloaded once per-session.
    - it would previously re-attempt to download the release data on failure endlessly.

### Fixed

* search tab filter buttons are now a uniform height.
* `key` column in the addon detail "raw data" widget is now wide enough for the text "supported game tracks".
* `updated` column in the installed addon tab is now wide enough for the text "12 months ago".
* possible cache stampede fetching strongbox release info. A lock is now acquired to ensure checks happen sequentially.
    - it was possible for the GUI to fire off many requests to Github simultaneously, bypassing cache and overwriting each other.

### Removed

* Tukui support. Tukui addons are:
    - no longer checked for updates.
    - excluded from being imported.
    - excluded from the user-catalogue.
    - no longer scraped from the tukui.org API into a catalogue.
    - no longer present in the "full" or "short" catalogues.
    - excluded from search results.
    - removed from the 'emergency' (built-in, hardcoded) catalogue (used when remote catalogues are unavailable).
    - removed from lists of available addon hosts to switch an addon between.

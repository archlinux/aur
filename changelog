### Added

* filtering search results by tag can now be switched between inclusive ('any of', default) and exclusive ('all of').
* embedded font for glyphs used in the uber and star buttons for systems running with minimal fonts.
    - https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox/issues/384
* an app launcher to desktop environments that support them.
    - for me, `strongbox` was found under the `Games` menu item.
    - only for installations via the AUR
        - the `.desktop` file can be found here: https://github.com/ogri-la/strongbox-pkgbuild/blob/master/strongbox.desktop

### Changed

* search results filtered by tag are no longer sampled when no search input is available.
    - this means you can now browse addons by tags alone if there are more addons that can fit on a single page of results.
* glyphs used for the uber and star buttons switched to their close equivalents in the new embedded font
    - they're a little chunkier now but also look a little better in my estimation.
* moved some files used for building the AppImage from the root into a directory called `AppImage`.

### Fixed

* page >1 of search results that were then filtered further may have displayed the 'mascot' screen (ᕙ[°▿°]ᕗ)
    - this was because the pagination wasn't being reset and there was no 'page N' for the given set of filters.
    - the 'mascot' screen is still (deliberately) displayed in rare cases.
* characters in multi-line messages in the notice logger no longer get their descenders ('y', 'g', 'p', etc) truncated.
* ignored addons in the addon detail pane now display mutual dependencies (if any).
* 'WoW' column text was black with a dark background in dark mode, making the value illegible.

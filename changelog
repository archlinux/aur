### Added

* added checkbox to bottom of search tab that will toggle search results sampling when search results are unfiltered.
    - this lets you browse a catalogue page by page.
* added patch tooltips for Dragonflight 10.1 and 10.2
* added support for the `NO_COLOR` environment variable.
    - it turns off coloured output in the console if that is where you launched strongbox from.
* added new command line action `print-config` that prints the final config and exits.
    - usage: `./strongbox --action print-config`
* added new information captured from the environment when using `--debug` or `--action print-config`.
    - `state.paths.config-dir`, path to where Strongbox is storing the application *config*.
    - `state.paths.data-dir`, path to where Strongbox is storing the application *data*.
    - `flatpak-id`, looks like `la.ogri.strongbox` when running within a Flatpak.
* added plain-text and JSON views of the raw addon data to the 'raw data' widget on the addon detail tab.
    - it's pretty basic but JavaFX really resists being able to select text within it's widgets.
* added new preference 'check for update' that toggles checking for an update to Strongbox on startup (default is `true`).
* added new command line flag `--update-check` and it's complement `--no-update-check` that toggles update checks.
* added Flatpak distribution hosted by Flathub
    - see: https://flathub.org/en-GB/apps/la.ogri.strongbox

### Changed

* bumped JavaFX dependencies from 17.x to 19.x.
* removed the fixed widths on the 'updated' and 'downloads' columns in the search pane.
    - attempting to control column widths in a JavaFX table is futile.
* some `info` level logging has been dropped to `debug` to reduce console noise.

### Fixed

* tag buttons in search pane are now centred vertically.
* selecting hosts in search pane no longer samples results.
* 'interface version' was being treated as an integer and being localised in the raw data widget.

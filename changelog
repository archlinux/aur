### Added

* `x-website` Github URLs in `.toc` files are now treated as a Github source that an addon can be switched to.
    - when both `x-github` and Github `x-website` sources exist, `x-github` takes priority.

### Changed

* moved AppImage building to `ogri-la/strongbox-appimage`.
* consolidated all the `.sh` into a single `manage.sh` script.
    - `lint.sh` moved to `manage.sh` as command 'lint'.
    - `run-tests.sh` moved to `manage.sh` as command 'test'.
    - `update-test-fixtures.sh` moved to `manage.sh` as command 'update-test-fixtures'.
    - `build-linx-image.sh` moved to `ogri-la/strongbox-appimage` as `build-appimage.sh`.

### Fixed

* fixed bug preventing classic Wrath `.toc` from being detected and loaded.
* fixed bug in catalogue location spec where a value that should have been validating as a URL was not.
* removed `x-tukui-id` source detection in `.toc` files. Tukui no longer hosts addons so these can't be used.
    - overlooked, should have been part of 7.0.0 major version.

### Removed

* removed `release.sh` as it had been unused for several years.

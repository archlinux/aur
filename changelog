* issue #402, fixed a freezing bug in the search results, introduced in 5.1.0 (2022-03-02).
    - if the 'full' catalogue were selected, searching and selecting a result would freeze the GUI.
        - it may possibly have disabled mouse events as well, depending on your window manager.
    - No definite cause found, however the bug was quacking suspicously like a deadlock/livelock.
    - Thanks to @sergen213 for their help and feedback.

	* 0.12-1 :
	  new upstream release:
	      New functionality:
	      * check-rules sieve: New parameter 'byrule' to list failed messages
		at the end of processing sorted by rule identifier.
	      * new unfuzzy-qtclass-only sieve: Unfuzzy messages which were
		fuzzied due to C++ class name change in code, in catalogs
		derived by conversion from Qt Linguist translation files.
	      * posummit: New field to set the precedence of summit subdirectories
		(S.subdir_precedence), so that branch catalogs existing in
		two or more branch subdirectories are always located in
		the higher priority summit subdirectory.
		When processing summit catalogs with some precedence set,
		the order of processing is also following the precedence,
		instead of being alphabetical by path throughout.
	      * Syntax highlighting for code snippets in the user manual.
	      * Updated language support (spelling, rules, etc):
		Catalan, French, Galician, Norwegian, Serbian, Spanish.
	      * Updated project-specific support: KDE.

	      Modified functionality:
	      * stats sieve: File with list of incomplete catalogs
		(when setting 'incompfile' parameter ) is always written,
		even if all catalogs are complete, i.e. empty list file is produced.
		This prevents an old list file appearing as the new one.
	      * posummit: When branch catalogs without expected corresponding
		summit catalogs are detected (on merge and scatter), instead of
		error a warning is issued. It has been seen in practice that
		higher attention demanded by error was more trouble than worth.
		Such branch catalogs are then skipped during the operation.

	      Fixed bugs:
	      * Word wrapping of message fields when writing catalogs was wrong
		in some cases when visual and character word lengths were different
		(e.g. CJK languages). This could have resulted in corrupted catalogs.
	      * stats sieve: Heuristics for splitting word count from fuzzy messages
		into translated/untranslated (when 'ondiff' parameter is issued)
		will no longer cause negative additions.
	      * More detailed licensing information throughout.
	      * Adapted VCS handling for Subversion 1.7.
	  python2-pygments added to makedepends

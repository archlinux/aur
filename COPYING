However, the binary distribution is licensed under GNU General Public License, version 3 or (at your option) any later version (GPLv3+),

License in all respects for all of the code used other than "OpenSSL".  If you
modify file(s), you may extend this exception to your version of the file(s),
but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this
exception statement from your version.

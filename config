# RAM in megabytes, defaults to 2048.
#RAM=2048

# Number of CPU cores, defaults to 2.
#CORES=2

# CPU definition, defaults to "host"
# Default Example:
#CPU="host"
# Test with old CPU:
#CPU="core2duo"

# "video=" string to pass to the kernel. Defaults to no string set.
#VIDEO="1280x720x32"

# Data partition location.
# If a file is specified it will be a raw image and created if it does not
# exist.  By default, it will create a file at $HOME/.config/android-x86/data.img
# as a sparse file with an EXT4 filesystem.
# If a directory is specified, it'll be mounted as a 9p share.  QEMU must run under
# sudo and will pop a terminal if run graphically.
# If set to "none", no data partition will be set.
# Example:
#DATA="none" # Save no data
#DATA="/tmp/data.img" # Create a data file in /tmp. 

# Data partition size in megabytes.  Only used on creation of a partition image.
# defaults to 2048.
#DATASIZE=2048

# Note: right now the only thing that's working right now with VirGL on machines tested
# is SDL with an external serial0.   GTK shows the serial but no video, SDL shows
# the windows all overlayed with each other.

# Serial output.  Currently a rootshell.  Defaults to no serial.
#
# Examples:
# default stdio, will pop a terminal in graphical mode
SERIAL="mon:stdio" # console on terminal or in urxvt if gui mode.
#SERIAL="telnet:127.0.0.1:9000,server,nowait"  # telnet to port 900 for root, might be insecure

# Bridged networking.  
#
# If you use a bridged network for vitual machines, you can set it here.
# Otherwise it uses user networking.  Make sure to allow the bridge in /etc/qemu/bridge.conf
#BRIDGE=outer0

# Method to launch QEMU.  Example is default, which uses SDL and allow for
# VirGL, which is a feature as of 8.1-r1.  For some reason GTK isn't working on all
# the tested machines, only SDL.
# Example (default):
#VGALINE="-vga virtio -display sdl,gl=on"

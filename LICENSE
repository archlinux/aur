%%% This is a preliminary version, barring acceptance from the 
%%% LaTeX Project Team and other feedback, of the GUST Font Nosource
%%% License. This license is for use with free fonts distributed 
%%% without source code, e.g., fonts created with visual tools.
%%%

% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the conditions 
% of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3a of this 
% license or (at your option) any later version, provided that the 
% following additional clauses are observed:
%
% 1) As there is no universally relevant concept of font source files,
%    no distinction is made between "Work" and "Compiled Work"; hence, 
%    the relevant clauses of the LaTeX Project Public License should 
%    be interpreted accordingly.
% 2) Due to the nature of fonts, clause 6a of the LaTeX Project Public 
%    License, version 1.3a, does not apply.  A later version of the 
%    LaTeX Project Public License may number or word this clause 
%    differently; it is the substance that is important.
% 3) It is requested, but not legally required, that derived works be 
%    distributed only after changing the names of the fonts comprising 
%    this work and given in the accompanying file MANIFEST.txt, and 
%    that the files comprising the Work, as listed in MANIFEST.txt also
%    be given new names. Any exceptions to this request are also given 
%    in MANIFEST.txt.
% 
% The latest version of the LaTeX Project Public License is in
% http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt and version 1.3a or later
% is part of all distributions of LaTeX version 2004/10/01 or later.

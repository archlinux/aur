Subscriptions

Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.

At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Penguin Labs, LLC cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Cacher customer support team (support@cacher.io).

A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Penguin Labs, LLC with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Penguin Labs, LLC to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

At any time and without notice, Penguin Labs, LLC reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.
Fee Changes

Penguin Labs, LLC, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

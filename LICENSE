If Software is removed by Xerox for this reason, any designated license fees paid by you will be fully refunded; if no portion of the amounts paid to Xerox within the transaction in which the Software was acquired was designated as a license fee for the Software, Xerox shall refund that portion of the amounts paid that Xerox reasonably designates as associated with the Software's acquisition.

11. ENTIRE AGREEMENT 
This License Agreement is the entire agreement between Xerox and you pertaining to the Software and supersedes all proposals or prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings of the parties regarding the Software. You agree that any terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or other ordering document submitted to order the Software shall have no binding effect on Xerox and will not modify this Agreement in any way. 

If, after reading the terms and conditions, they are unacceptable to you, then, to avoid contractual obligations and liability, you should promptly return the software unused, and you will then be entitled to a refund of any sums paid by you to license the Software.

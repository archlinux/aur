The Site is operated by pCloud AG (hereinafter referred to as "pCloud", "we", "us" and "our"). We are a company registered in Switzerland. Our registered office is at: 74 Zugerstrasse Str, 6340 Baar, Switzerland.

Changes to these Terms
From time to time, we may change these Terms and Conditions (“The Terms”). If we change these Terms, we will inform you by posting the revised Terms on the Site.

Additional Terms
Some of our Services have additional terms and conditions ("Additional Terms"). Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, we will make them available for you to read through, prior to your use of that Service. By using the Services, you agree to the Additional Terms.

Access to the Site
In order to use the Site or Services, you must first register to set up an account with us by completing the account registration form available on the Site. Millions of people trust pCloud with their files. We also trust you to use the pCloud services responsibly. You only need to register once. Registration is subject to approval by us in all cases, and we reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, to decline any application for registration, without giving a reason. Registering more than one pCloud account on your behalf will be treated as an abuse of our service, and we reserve the right to suspend your access to the services.

You must ensure that any registration details you provide are accurate. Please check carefully the details you have provided in the online form before finalizing your application to register. You can check for errors on screen before submitting the online form. You are responsible for ensuring that the details you provide us with are correct and complete, and for informing us of any changes to the information you have provided. You can access and update the information you have provided us with, including your account settings, in the relevant area of the Site.

If your application to register to use the Site and Services is accepted, you will be assigned the username (email) and password you submitted with your application (together referred to as your "Credentials"). You must keep your Credentials confidential and must not reveal them to anyone.

You are responsible for all activities performed under your Credentials. You must notify us immediately if you know of, or suspect, that anyone has obtained access to your Credentials, or if you otherwise become aware of any unauthorized use of your Credentials or another security breach.

Unless we have previously been notified by you that the confidentiality of your Credentials has been compromised, we are entitled to treat any use of the Site under your Credentials as being by you.

We may disable access via your Credentials at any time if, in our opinion, this is reasonably necessary to preserve the security and proper operation of the Site or Services, if you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering prove to be false.

It is your responsibility to ensure your computer system meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and use the Site and Services and is compatible with the Site. It is also your responsibility to ensure that anyone who accesses the Site or Services using your Credentials or via your Internet connection is aware of these Terms and that they comply with them.

Access to the Site and Services is permitted on a temporary basis and we reserve the right to withdraw, modify or suspend the Site or Services without notice.

pCloud reserves the right to limit the traffic generated by one or more of the download links you have generated based solely on pCloud’s discretion. In such occurrences, access to content on these links will be restricted for registered Premium and Premium Plus users only.

In the case of such a restriction being imposed, users who have subscribed to Premium plans will be given the option to purchase additional traffic for the limited download link(s). The threshold for traffic generated from the download links of Premium and Premium Plus plans subscribers is set higher than the one of the users on a free plan.

If the usage of the Service exceeds the storage quota of your account, pCloud will inform you. If you do not correct your overuse (by upgrading your service plan or deleting files), pCloud may, in its sole discretion and without further notice, move files to the Trash of your account on a random basis.

Once you delete a file from your pCloud account, it will be moved to a section named "Trash" in your account. The file will be stored there for a limited time period that is based on your service plan. pCloud reserves the right to limit the size of the Trash on pCloud's sole discretion. The Trash has a size limit exactly equal to the storage quota, included in your current pCloud account. In case the Trash size limit is exceeded, pCloud reserves the right to permanently remove the oldest files from the Trash to fit the preassigned limits.

Repeat Infringers
We can undertake measures, in our discretion, if you are determined to be a repeat infringer.

Privacy
pCloud respects your privacy. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information about you. By using the Site or the Services, you also agree to our Privacy Policy.

Encryption
Among other services and applications, pCloud also provides an encryption service under the trademark pCloud Crypto. This app performs client-side encryption, which means that the encryption process is performed on the user’s device and the plain text files never leave the user’s computer. This ensures zero-knowledge privacy for the user’s data, which means that we, as a service provider, have absolutely no information about the content users store in their accounts, such as file names or file types. The user content is stored in their Crypto Folder, which is locked and unlocked using the so-called Passphrase. pCloud has no access to user’s Passphrase, and once lost, it can never be restored.

Encrypted Content and Ownership
In these Terms, "Encrypted Content" shall be used to refer to all content and information that you store or upload using the Encryption Service. All Encrypted Content shall be owned by you or the person who made it available to you to store or upload via the Service. You retain full ownership to your files, folders, directories, including their metadata (file names, thumbnails, etc.) and any information you submit to pCloud for encryption purposes. We don’t claim any ownership to any of your content. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your content or intellectual property except for the following limited rights that are needed to run the Service: we may redundantly store or backup your respective data as set below and we might use trusted third parties, like our collocated data center, to provide the Encryption Service. You give us the permission for all and any actions that we need to undertake to provide the Service. In particular, but not limited to, you agree that pCloud may transfer your data to its servers and between its servers. pCloud states that your encrypted content, encryption key, and passphrase used by you or otherwise submitted to the Service, are stored in an encrypted or non-invertible form. Your Encrypted Content cannot be decrypted or inverted by pCloud or any third party. Your Encrypted Content can only be decrypted or inverted by you. When using our Encryption service, you undertake that:

you own all rights to your Encrypted Content and you have the right to give pCloud the rights described above;
you have paid and will pay in full any fees or other payments that may be related to the use of your Encrypted Content and the Service; and
your Encrypted Content does not infringe the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, publicity rights, or other legal rights of any third party.
Global Policies on Encryption
In some countries, using encryption services may be limited, restricted or forbidden by law. Before subscribing to our Encryption Service - pCloud Crypto - make sure that using such a service is permitted and legal in your state of residence. If any case, pCloud cannot be held liable for any claims that may be filed against you in relation to using such a service. By agreeing with the present Terms and Conditions you confirm that you will at all times and in any instances hold pCloud harmless of any claims that may arise in relation to your personal decision to use an Encryption Service, in this case, pCloud Crypto.

Third Party Content and Interactions
The Site and Services may contain features and functionalities that may link you or provide you with access to third-party content or services independent of pCloud, including websites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole. Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Site and Services are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any interaction with any of these third parties. You agree that pCloud shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any dealings you have with third parties.

Disputes with Other Users
If there is a dispute between users of the Site or Services, you understand and agree that pCloud is under no obligation to investigate or become involved further than any action it may take in accordance with notification it receives pursuant to the copyright and intellectual property notice section above. Subject to this, pCloud may, in its discretion, attempt to assist in the resolution of such a dispute, but in doing so it does not undertake any obligation to do so, and will not be subject to any liability arising either from the conduct giving rise to the dispute or from any efforts to resolve it.

Disclaimer and Waiver of Liability
In the event that you have a dispute with any other user of the Site or Services or with any third party whose content or services you have accessed through the Sites or Services, you hereby release pCloud, its officers, employees, agents and successors in rights from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes. If you are a resident of California, U.S.A., you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which stipulates the following: A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

Payment
Some of our Services are free, whereas others are subject to a fee. For a full description of the different Services that we offer, along with the different prices applicable, please see the Services and price description page on the Site.

Subscription Plans
pCloud users can pay for several paid plans for extra space and sharing options. By subscribing once, you authorize pCloud to charge your chosen payment method. pCloud offers renewal subscriptions and lifetime subscriptions.

Renewal Subscriptions
pCloud users can pay for paid plans on a renewing period basis (for example, monthly and yearly plans).

Renewal
All paid renewal subscriptions are renewed for the Services on the date such renewal subscriptions expire. If you have a renewal subscription, this will be extended automatically until you terminate it and every further payment will be due at the beginning of the new payment cycle.

Lifetime Subscriptions
pCloud users can pay for a lifetime plan. A lifetime plan is in effect for the duration of the account owner or 99 years, whichever is shorter.

Payments for and Cancellation of Subscriptions
You can cancel your subscriptions for the pCloud Service at any time from your payment account. However, no refund will be provided for any unused days.

All users who subscribe for Services subject to a fee ("Paid Services") must enter valid credit [or debit] card or PayPal account credentials. The Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis (depending on the selection you make at the point of subscription) and paid on an automatic basis. You hereby authorize pCloud to automatically charge your credit card or PayPal account for charges that apply to your account. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, including VAT, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, duties or VAT, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes.

If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with the Paid services, you can cancel your subscription for Paid Services at any time.

pCloud has a ten (10) calendar days money back guarantee, beginning on the day you have submitted your payment for the Paid services. During this period, you are eligible to request for a refund. If you issue an explicit written request for a refund within the ten (10) days referenced above, we will process the refund due to you in full within 30 calendar days, counting from the day you have confirmed your request.

We will usually refund any money received from you using the same method originally used by you to pay for your purchase.

In case you have purchased Paid services through a promotional campaign or provided discount, pCloud reserves the right to decline providing a refund.

Links
Our Site and Services may contain links to other websites, or allow other users to send you such links. A link to a third-party website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We are not responsible or liable for any damage or loss related to the use of any third-party website. You should always read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of a third-party website before using it.

Changes to the Site or Services
pCloud enhances and updates its Site and Services often. We may change or discontinue the Site or any Services although we will, in such circumstances, use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice so that you can make alternative arrangements for the storage of any User Content and we will not terminate a Service under this section during a subscription period for which you have already paid without refunding you a fair portion of your payment based on how long is left until the end of the subscription.

No Transfer of Accounts
User accounts are not transferable. Only the user who signs up for an account may use the account. If a user transfers an account in violation of this section, pCloud may terminate the account and the users’ right to access the Site and Services.

Change of Ownership
pCloud may at any time, without explicit notice, change the company ownership, be subject to merger or sale, partnership or else. In the case of such change of ownership, merger, sale or other, pCloud only has the obligation to notify you through updating the present Terms and Conditions. Such an action will in no way affect your use of the Service or the Site, or your subscriptions and accounts.

Termination
We reserve the right not to provide the Site or Services to any user. We also reserve the right to terminate any user's right to access the Site or Services at any time, in our discretion. If you breach any of these Terms, your permission to use the Site and Services and your account automatically terminate. If pCloud ceases operation, your account will be terminated and pCloud will no longer provide the Site or Services. If your account is terminated in accordance with this section, you will not receive any refund of any fees paid for the account.

YOU USE THE SITE AND SERVICES AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE APPLICABLE LAW, PCLOUD AND ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS (REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS "AFFILIATES") DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE AND SERVICES (INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR USE OR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT).

IN PARTICULAR, PCLOUD AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RECOMMENDATIONS OR OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SITE OR SERVICES), OR THE CONTENT OF ANY WEBSITES OR RESOURCES LINKED TO THE SITE OR SERVICES.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIAL OR INFORMATION DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES IS DONE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE ARISING FROM DOING SO.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent pCloud may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of pCloud's liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.

If we do assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with pCloud in such defense.

Other Provisions
Under no circumstances will pCloud be held liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of nature or other causes beyond its reasonable control.

You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such claim or action. If a European Union user of the Site or Services is located outside of Bulgaria, then, for the purposes of any claim or action relating to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, the Site, or any Services, the applicable jurisdiction will be the courts that are located in the territory of residence of such European User.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions.

The failure of pCloud to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent pCloud from enforcing such right or provision in the future.

We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law.

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any Additional Terms, as they may be revised from time to time, constitute our complete agreement with you, and supersede any other written materials, communications, discussions, representations, or understandings relating to the Site or the Services or your use of them.

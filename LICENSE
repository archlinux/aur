understanding and agreement that these Standard Terms and Conditions:
(i) represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the
parties, (ii) may not be modified, supplemented, explained or waived by parol
evidence, Licensee’s purchase order, any course of dealing, ExpanDrive’s
performance or delivery, or in any other way except in writing hand signed by
an authorized representative of ExpanDrive, and (iii) are intended to cover all
activity of ExpanDrive and Licensee hereunder including any services to be
rendered by ExpanDrive in connection with the licensing of the Products. Any
reference in ExpanDrive’s invoice, or otherwise, to Licensee’s specifications
or requirements is solely for the purpose of describing the products and
services covered hereby and shall not serve to either to: (a) adopt those
specifications or requirements as part of the parties’ agreements, or
(b) modify any of the terms of this agreement, particularly (and not in
limitation of the generality of the foregoing) as regards the parties’
understanding that this agreement establishes that no warranty is being
provided by ExpanDrive regarding Licensee’s use of the Products or services. By
way of clarification, and not in limitation of the generality of the foregoing,
it is specifically agreed that statements on ExpanDrive’s website and elsewhere
are issued for general and informational purposes only and shall not be deemed
to modify the provisions hereof or form the basis for a claim that ExpanDrive
provided a warranty of any kind. The agreement formed hereby and the language
contained herein shall be construed and enforced under the Uniform Commercial
Code in effect in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (being the home office
location of ExpanDrive) on the date hereof.”

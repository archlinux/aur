By purchasing a Product (and subject to your compliance with this Agreement), Muse Sounds grants to you (and only you) a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferrable license to download and use the Products you download from Muse Sounds PROVIDED ALWAYS that you use the download Sound File(s) only within your own newly-created sound recording(s) and/or performances in a manner that renders the Sound File(s) substantially dissimilar to the original sound of the Sound File in each case. The Products are the property of Muse Sounds and are licensed to you only for use as part of a live or recorded musical performance. You may not use these sounds for any commercial or non-commercial purpose except where you have combined them with other sounds within one or more musical composition(s) and/or recording(s). This license expressly forbids resale or other distribution of the Products or their derivatives, either as they exist in the library, reformatted for use in another sampler, or mixed, combined, filtered, re-synthesized or otherwise edited, for use as sounds, multi-sounds, samples, multi-samples, sound sets, programs or patches in a sampler, microchip, computer or any sample playback device or in any audio library. You may not sell any Product(s), or give away any Product(s) for use by any other person(s). Products may not be used in or in relation to any competitive products that are sold or relicensed to any third parties. Except as expressly permitted herein, to the fullest extent of applicable law you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lease any Product, and you may not reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of any Product.

 

5. No Resale of Products. For the avoidance of doubt, you are granted a personal non-transferable license to use the Products solely for your own personal use. Products are for use only as described hereunder and must not be shared with or given or transferred to any third party or uploaded to any file sharing site or offered for resale or public transmission unless mixed into your own original music productions. The license granted to you is effective only from the date you download, install or use the Product(s) (whichever is earliest) and such license will remain in force until terminated by Muse Sounds as a result of any breach by you of this Agreement.

 

6. Ownership. Ownership of, and title to, the Products (and all digitally recorded sounds and/or copies therein) is held by Muse Sounds. Copies are provided to you solely to enable you to exercise your rights hereunder. When you download any Product(s), you are granted a limited license for use (and not ownership) of Product(s). Except as expressly authorized in this Agreement, you may not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, distribute, transfer, copy, reproduce, display, modify or time share any Product(s) or Documentation (or part or element thereof).

 

7. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically without notice from Muse Sounds if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Product(s) and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Product(s).

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

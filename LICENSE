Data (files) received by User, including during streaming playback of Audio and Video content, through these Programs, are cached on User’s personal computer and stored in encrypted form in Cache folder, directory for which is assigned by User. Cached files are intended only for technical use in order to speed up data loading between Users within work of BitTorrent protocol and are not available for playback by User.

IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, SUCH INDIVIDUAL MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICE. CAPITALIZED TERMS HAVE THE DEFINITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:

1. The Service

1.1. Service Description. SKlauncher is the provider of a free, independent Minecraft launcher service ("Service").

2. Liability

2.1. User Responsibility. Use of the Service is at the user's own risk. While SKlauncher prides itself on the long-standing and unblemished reputation of its software's safety, which can be verified on various antivirus report websites, it cannot guarantee the safety of any additional modifications ("mods") that users may download for use in the game. Users are solely responsible for any damage to their computer system or loss of data that results from the download or use of such mods. However, the SKlauncher software itself is designed to be safe and reliable, and SKlauncher disclaims all liability for any harm that may occur as a result of using the Service.

4.2. User Submissions. Users retain all ownership rights in and to their User Submissions. By posting, uploading, or otherwise providing a User Submission to the Service, the user grants SKlauncher a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the Service and SKlauncher's business.

6.2. While SKlauncher currently allows access to all Minecraft users, both offline and premium, this may be subject to change in the future based on various factors, including but not limited to changes in the terms of service, changes in laws and regulations, or changes in the relationship between SKlauncher and other parties.

7. Disclaimer of Warranties

7.1. The Service is provided "as is" and on an "as available" basis, without any warranties of any kind to the fullest extent permitted by law, including but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

You may not join any of the foregoing to other words, symbols, or numbers, either as one word or with a hyphen.

A Mark should be followed by a notice that it is being used as a trademark whenever possible. The trademark superscript symbol is preferred, but if it is not available, use parentheses such as, for example: (TM).
2. Account registration

Registration on Overwolf or CurseForge is optional. If you choose to register to either Overwolf or CurseForge dedicated Overwolf or CurseForge account will be created (the “Account”). Your Account allows you to participate in certain Services, subject to the Terms and the Overwolf Privacy Policy, which is available at Privacy policy. Overwolf reserves the right to refuse to allow a User to open an Account for any reason, or to limit the number of Accounts a User can establish with respect to the Services, all at Overwolf's sole discretion.

To create an Account, you must select a username and password. Your username is your Overwolf or CurseForge identity. You may not select a username that is used by someone else, and your username cannot be indecent, or otherwise offensive, or be used in any way that violates these Terms and common practices. You may not provide false information during the registration process. You must provide truthful and accurate information while creating your Account.

You should not reveal your password to other users. Overwolf will not ask you to reveal your password. If you forget your password, you can request to have your password reset. Your Account is at risk if you let someone use it inappropriately and your Account is subject to termination if you or anyone using your Account violates Overwolf Terms. If your Account is terminated, you may not join Overwolf or CurseForge again without its express permission.

You agree to immediately notify Overwolf of any unauthorized use of your Account or password. You are fully and solely responsible for the security of your computer system and all activity on your Account, even if such activities were not committed by you. Overwolf will not be liable for any losses or damage arising from unauthorized use of your Account or password, and you agree to indemnify and hold Overwolf harmless for any improper or illegal use of your Account. This includes illegal or improper use by someone to whom you have given permission to use your Account.
3. Termination of Account/s

You agree that Overwolf may for any reason, at its sole discretion and without notice, terminate your Account, and remove from the Services any Content associated with your Account. Grounds for such termination may include but shall not be limited to (i) extended periods of inactivity, (ii) violation of the letter or spirit of these Terms, (iii) fraudulent, harassing or abusive behavior or (iv) behavior that is harmful to other users, third parties, or the business interests of Overwolf.

If Overwolf believes, at its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms or any illegal or inappropriate behavior has occurred, we may take any other corrective action we deem appropriate. We reserve the right to investigate suspected violations of these Terms or illegal and inappropriate behavior on the Services. We will fully cooperate to a court order requesting or directing us to disclose any information we might have including the identity of anyone believed to have violated these Terms or to have engaged in illegal behavior on the Services. You may request termination of your Account at any time and for any reason by sending an email to support@overwolf.com. Any suspension, termination, or cancellation shall not affect your obligations to Overwolf under these Terms (including but not limited to ownership, indemnification, and limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, termination, or cancellation.
4. Payments

App and mod developers decide and control how to monetize their apps and mods. Some may choose to provide them free of charge, some may choose to place ads, some may choose to ask for a paid subscription managed by Overwolf and some may provide links to third party payment systems (for which Overwolf has no liability). Overwolf facilitates those services for some of the app and mod developers by partnering with select partners and providing an SDK/API to easily control and manage the payments. When a Member signs up for a subscription, it will automatically charge him/her the applicable payment every month. The subscription months will be calculated from the date of payment. The Member may cancel the subscription at any time, such that s/he will continue to receive the benefits in connection with the subscription until the end of that month and his/her subscription will end at the end of that month. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend offered subscription plans at any time in accordance with these Terms. Subscription prices may change, including recurring subscription fees from time to time and we will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. Subject to applicable law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the applicable Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with a price change, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the subscription prior to the price change going into effect.

Overwolf currently facilitates payments through PayPal and Xsolla's platform. Xsolla is also an authorized global distributor of the Platform. Overwolf may add or change payment methods in its sole discretion. You must respect the terms and conditions of any payment methods you use. We reserve the right to cancel any Services ordered if full payment is not timely received. We reserve the right to cancel any transaction that we have reason to believe to have been fraudulently made, including by unauthorized use of a credit card, debit card, or other payment method.

You are solely responsible for any taxes on amounts you may pay or obtain through the Services. Overwolf will deduct applicable charges and taxes from any payable amounts, as required by law.

Hibernate 2.1.7c:
Hibernate is Free Software.
The LGPL license is sufficiently flexible to allow the use of Hibernate in both open source and commercial projects. The LGPL
guarantees that Hibernate and any modifications made to Hibernate will stay open source, protecting our and your work. Anyone
who wanted to release Hibernate under a different license would have to obtain permission from hundreds of people who have
contributed code to Hibernate, which would be impractical. Hibernate is and will be open source distributed under the LGPL.
March 10, 2006
13Using Hibernate (by importing Hibernate's public interfaces in your Java code), and extending Hibernate (by subclassing or
implementation of an extension interface) is considered by the authors of Hibernate to be dynamic linking. Hence our
interpretation of the LGPL is that the use of the unmodified Hibernate source does not affect the license of your application code.
The use of the unmodified Hibernate binary of course never affects the license of your application or distribution. The LGPL
also forbids distribution for profit, so you will never have to pay money to any commercial entity for using or integrating
Hibernate.
If you modify Hibernate and redistribute your modifications, the LGPL applies. Please submit any modifications to our JIRA
issue tracking system.
A copy of the LGPL can be found at the end of this file.

19The Perl Artistic License
Preamble
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder
maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the
right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.
Definitions
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
through textual modification.
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of
the Copyright Holder as specified below.
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a
market that must bear the fee.)
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It
also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without
  restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the
  Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each
  changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
4.
5.
a. place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting
  said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
 such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard
Version of the Package.
b. use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
c. rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must
  also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
 documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
d. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE
of the following:
a. distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual
  page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.
b. accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.
c. give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or
  equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
d. make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for
support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in
aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own. You may embed this Package's interpreter
within an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere form of aggregation, provided that the
complete Standard Version of the interpreter is so embedded.
March 10, 2006
206. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this Package do not
  automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
 commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package. If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a binary executable image, then distribution of
such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of
Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.
7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package
  in order to emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this Package shall not be considered part of
 this Package, but are the equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language
in any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the language.
8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always permitted provided that the use of this Package is
  embedded; that is, when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible to the end user of the
 commercial distribution. Such use shall not be construed as a distribution of this Package.
9. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without
  specific prior written permission.
10. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Version 2, June 1991
Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)
You can apply it to your programs, too.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do
these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission
to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not
the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations.
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that
any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0.
This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work,
and a “work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) Each licensee is addressed as
“you”.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The
act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a
work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on
what the Program does.
1.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.
March 10, 2006
222.
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
  any change.
b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
  Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
 License.
c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
  running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
 appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)
and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3.
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
  the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than
  your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding
 source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or,
c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
  alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or
 executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,
plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
  attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
 under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
  modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
 License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or
works based on it.
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license
  from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
March 10, 2006
23impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
7.
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program
by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this
License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide
range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose
that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
  the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
 limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.
  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
 concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this
License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write
to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving
the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS”
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

24How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to
make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the
full notice is found.
<one line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.
This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w’.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c’ for details.
The hypothetical commands `show w’ and `show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of
course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w’ and `show c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or
menu items—whatever suits your program.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for
the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a
subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you
want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
March 10, 2006
25GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999
Copyright © 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,
hence the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software—to make sure the software is free for all its users.
This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages—typically libraries—of
the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully
about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the
explanations below.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to
make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive
source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender
these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we
gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must
provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and
recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you
legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the
original author’s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company
cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU
Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.
We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking
a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
We call this license the “Lesser” General Public License because it does Less to protect the user’s freedom than the ordinary
General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license
provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a
March 10, 2006
26free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body
of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the
whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users’ freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program
that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between
a “work based on the library” and a “work that uses the library”. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the
latter must be combined with the library in order to run.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0.
This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright
holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also
called “this License”). Each licensee is addressed as “you”.
A “library” means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
The “Library”, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A “work
based on the Library” means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing
the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.)
“Source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The
act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true
depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.
1.
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library’s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of
this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
exchange for a fee.
2.
You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
a. The modified work must itself be a software library.
b. You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
  any change.
c. You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
  License.
d. If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application
  program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make
 a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility
still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined
independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table
used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still
compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
March 10, 2006
27do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the
Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3.
You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License
applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library.
4.
You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties
are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
5.
A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
compiled or linked with it, is called a “work that uses the Library”. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a “work that uses the Library” with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
(because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a “work that uses the library”. The executable is therefore covered
by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a “work that uses the Library” uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the
work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is
not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small
inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
Library itself.
6.
As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a “work that uses the Library” with the Library to
produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the
terms permit modification of the work for the customer’s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use
are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright
notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the
copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
a.
March 10, 2006
Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including
whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the
work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable “work that uses the Library”,
as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of
definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
definitions.)
28b. Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at
  run time a copy of the library already present on the user’s computer system, rather than copying library
   functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user
  installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made
 with.
c. Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials
  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
d. If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to
  copy the above specified materials from the same place.
e. Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the “work that uses the Library” must include any data and utility programs needed
for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an
executable that you distribute.
7.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these
two things:
a. Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any
  other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
b. Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and
  explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License.
  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
 terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to
  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
 License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or
works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You
may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for
enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section
is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest
validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range
of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor
to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.
March 10, 2006
2912. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to
time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you
may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible
with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two
goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING
THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE
LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO
USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO
OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
March 10, 2006
30How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free
software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,
alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).
To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to
most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where
the full notice is found.
<one line to give the library’s name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.
You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for
the library, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
library `Frob’ (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

file with the Source Code distribution titled “LEGAL” which describes the claim and the party making the claim in
sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all
copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
news groups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
obtained.
(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor’s Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has
knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this
information in the LEGAL file.
(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor
believes that Contributor’s Modifications are Contributor’s original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
3.5.
Required Notices.
You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular
Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory) where a user
March 10, 2006
35would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor
to the notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You
describe recipients’ rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,
warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only
on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
3.6.
Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Section 3.1–3.5 have been met for that
Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that
the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code version from the
rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. If
you distribute executable versions containing Covered Code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in Exhibit B in
the documentation and/or other materials provided with the product.
3.7.
Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
for the Covered Code.
3.8.
Restrictions.
You may not remove any product identification, copyright, proprietary notices or labels from gSOAP.
4.
INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION.
If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible;
and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
5.
APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE.
This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
6.
6.1.
VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE.
New Versions.
Grantor may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
version number.
6.2.
Effect of New Versions.
Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may always continue to use it under the
terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License.
6.3.
Derivative Works.
If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already
Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrase “gSOAP” or any confusingly
similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it
clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the gSOAP Public License. (Filling in the name of the
Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be
modifications of this License.)

indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

42Common Public License - v 1.0
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE
("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S
ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
1. DEFINITIONS
"Contribution" means:
a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
i) changes to the Program, and
ii) additions to the Program; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the
Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not
include additions to the Program which:
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
license agreement, and
(ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute
and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code
form.
b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the
combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall
not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.
d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
3. REQUIREMENTS
A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
b) its license agreement:
i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and
fitness for a particular purpose;
ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
March 10, 2006
43iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any
other party; and
iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in
a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
When the Program is made available in source code form:
a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.
Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like.
While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby
agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs
(collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of
the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to
any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify
the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with
the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate
in any such claim at its own expense.
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a
Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product
X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and
warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
those damages.
5. NO WARRANTY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not
limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or
equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
7. GENERAL
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision
shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
March 10, 2006
44If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-
claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program
with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b)
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of
this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to
the Program shall continue and survive.
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is
copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new
versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to
modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement
Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The
Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of
America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action
arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.

3. Distribution Obligations.
3.1. Availability of Source Code.
March 10, 2006
47Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be
made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of
this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the
Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form
in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
3.2. Modifications.
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights
to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
3.3. Required Notices.
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the
Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
the Initial Developer.
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts
the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the
terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You
are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt
to limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely
clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability
incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
3.6. Larger Works.
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms
of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
4. Versions of the License.
4.1. New Versions.
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.
March 10, 2006
484.2. Effect of New Versions.
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the
terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software
available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
4.3. Modified Versions.
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You
may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any
references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE
COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-
INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS
WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO
USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
6. TERMINATION.
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with
terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which,
by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by
such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either
unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that the Participant Software
directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement)
prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by
such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of
any payment or license.
6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly
granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
distributor) shall survive termination.
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
March 10, 2006
49PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH
PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial
computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software
documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R.
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights
set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.
9. MISCELLANEOUS.
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export
administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or
otherwise make available any Covered Software.
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of
liability.
NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)
The OpenSolaris code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-
law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

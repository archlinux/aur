FOR MIT GAME LAB SOFTWARE

Redistribution Not Permitted

© 2012 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. All rights reserved.

THIS SOFTWARE IS BEING LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE FOR DEMONSTRATIONAL 
AND NON-COMMERCIAL PURPOSES ONLY

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ("MIT"), a non-profit 
institution of higher education, agrees to make the downloadable 
software and documentation, if any, (collectively, the "Software") 
available to you without charge for demonstrational and 
non-commercial purposes, subject to the following terms and 
conditions.

    Internal Use License. MIT hereby grants to you a 
non-transferable, nonexclusive royalty-free license (without any 
right to sublicense or distribute) to use the Software in 
machine-readable, object code form only and only as authorized in 
this License Agreement. You may use the Software on any single 
computer; use the Software on a second computer so long as the 
primary user of each copy is the same person and more than one 
copy is not simultaneously used; or copy the Software for archival 
purposes, provided any copy must contain all of the proprietary 
notices on the original Software. Neither concurrent use on two or 
more computers nor use in a local area network or other network is 
permitted, except as required by the game to function in a 
multiplayer environment provided that all users have their own 
separate authorization.

    Restrictions. You may not modify, translate, reverse engineer, 
decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the 
Software. You may not copy the Software, except as specified 
above. You may not sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise transfer 
rights to the Software. You may not remove any proprietary notices 
or labels on the Software.

    No Other Rights. MIT claims and reserves title to the Software 
and all rights and benefits afforded under any available United 
States and international laws protecting copyright and other 
intellectual property rights in the Software. Nothing herein shall 
be construed to limit the rights of MIT and its licensees to use, 
modify, adapt, or enhance the Software, or any derivative works 
based on the Software, for their own purposes. Nothing herein 
shall be construed to expand your rights with respect to the 
Software beyond those rights expressly granted you in paragraph 1.

    Termination. This License Agreement is effective upon your 
expressing agreement by clicking the "Agree" button below, or for 
instances when no button is present or otherwise disabled, when 
installing and using the software accompanying this license. This 
license will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with 
the limitations described above. On termination, you must 
uninstall and/or destroy all copies of the Software.

    Export Controls. You acknowledge that export of the Software 
may be subject to compliance with various laws, rules, and 
regulations that restrict the export of certain products and 
technical data. If you are within the United States, you represent 
that you will not export the Software outside of the United 
States, either directly or indirectly. If you are outside the 
United States, and if the Software is subject to U.S. export 
control restrictions, you are only allowed to obtain the Software 
in strict compliance with any applicable restrictions. If these 
restrictions are not observed, this license shall be null and 
void, and you shall immediately return or destroy the Software and 
all copies.

    Disclaimer of Warranty. You accept the Software on an "AS IS" 
basis. MIT MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE 
SOFTWARE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL SUCH WARRANTIES, INCLUDING 
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND 
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. MIT has no 
obligation to assist in your installation or use of the Software 
or to provide services or maintenance of any type with respect to 
the Software. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of 
the Software is borne by you. You acknowledge that the Software 
may contain errors or bugs. You must determine whether the 
Software sufficiently meets your requirements. This disclaimer of 
warranty constitutes an essential part of this Agreement.

    No Consequential Damages; Indemnification. IN NO EVENT SHALL 
MIT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS 
AGREEMENT. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to 
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MIT and its directors, 
officers, representatives, employees, and agents against all 
losses, expenses (including without limitation any legal 
expenses), claims, demands, suits, or other actions arising from 
your use of the Software, except to the extent caused by the gross 
negligence or willful misconduct of MIT.

    Miscellaneous. If any provision of this Agreement is held to 
be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be modified 
only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. You may not 
assign this Agreement. This Agreement shall be governed by and 
construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts irrespective of any conflicts of law principles. You 
agree that any legal action arising out of or in connection with 
this Agreement shall be brought in the state or Federal courts, as 
appropriate, in Suffolk County, Massachusetts. The applicability 
of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

    U.S. Government Restricted Rights. The Software and related 
documentation are "Commercial Items", as that term is defined at 
48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and 
"Commercial Computer Software Documentation", as such terms are 
used in 48 C.F.R. §52.227-19 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202. Consistent 
with 48 C.F.R. §52.227-19 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 
227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and

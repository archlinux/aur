You have a right to cancel your Subscription (i.e., turn off auto-renewals for the upcoming Service period) at any time (please note that canceled Subscriptions will not be refunded for the unused part of the ongoing Service period). Your possibilities to cancel the Subscription and/or get a refund may differ depending on whether you purchased Services from (or are billed through) Nord or a third party (e.g., app store, service provider, retailer).
Refund. We seek your full satisfaction with our Services. However, if you are not satisfied with our Services, you may cancel the Subscription and request a refund within thirty (30) days following your purchase of our Services (“Money Back Guarantee”). Please note that we do not grant Money Back Guarantee for the auto-renewed Subscription if you cancel the Subscription after the day of charge for such auto-renewal, unless applicable law provides otherwise. In any case, we would be glad to troubleshoot an issue you experienced before you decide to request a Money Back Guarantee.
Payment of Refund. Your request will be processed without any unreasonable delay and the refund will be paid using the same payment method as the one used for the purchase, except as otherwise mutually agreed, unless applicable law prohibits us or payment service providers we rely on from processing the refund. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the refund will be made in the same cryptocurrency or in another cryptocurrency if the one used for the purchase becomes unavailable or impracticable to use. The amount to be refunded in cryptocurrency will be calculated based on the equivalent of the price paid in USD at the time of purchase.

Eligibility for Refund. You can only get a refund for each of our Services under the Money Back Guarantee twice. If you buy a particular Service again after the second refund for such Service, you will not be granted a Money Back Guarantee for any of its further cancellation. In case you cancel your Subscription at any time after the expiration of the respective Money Back Guarantee period, you shall be charged for the whole Subscription's duration (e.g., if you purchase an annual Subscription and you decide to cancel your Subscription after two (2) months, you will be charged the whole price, but once Subscription has ended, it will not be renewed).
Subscriptions Purchased via Apple App Store. Subscriptions purchased via the Apple App Store are subject to Apple App Store refund policies. This means we cannot grant a refund if you made a purchase through the Apple App Store - please read Apple's in-app purchase refund policy and/or contact store support.

BUNDLED SUBSCRIPTIONS AND THIRD PARTY SERVICES
Bundled Subscriptions. You may purchase Subscription of Nord Service bundled with the Subscription of other Nord Service and/or subscription of Third Party Services (as described below) (“Bundled Subscriptions”).
Third Party Services Purchased through Nord. We may offer to purchase third party products and/or services independently (as a standalone service) or along with our Services (as a Bundled Subscription) through Nord (“Third Party Services”) (e.g., Incogni tool, created by our sister company Surfshark). In all cases, your billing relationship for such services will be directly with Nord and any fees charged for it will be billed by us using your provided payment method. Please note that Third Party Services are governed not only by these Terms but also by terms of use issued by such third parties respectively (which you also accept by purchasing Third Party Services through Nord). Please review the terms of use and other policies of Third Party Services carefully and make sure you understand them before you purchase them through Nord. After you complete your purchase of Third Party Services through Nord, you may need to follow additional instructions to create a separate account for subscription to and use of them. If there is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of use of Third Party Services and these Terms concerning Subscription purchase, auto-renewals, prices/payments, and cancellation/refunds, these Terms govern and apply.
Cancellation of Bundled Subscription/Third Party Services. You may cancel your Bundled Subscription/Third Party Services (i.e., turn off auto-renewals for the upcoming Service period) at any time. By canceling your Bundled Subscription, you will lose access to all Bundled Services (i.e., if you wish to cancel, the only option is to cancel all Nord Services and Third Party Services purchased as a Bundled Subscription; you cannot cancel only one or some of the Services leaving the others active for the upcoming period).

GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Governing Law. These Terms will be governed by the law of Panama except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including countries of the European Union) have laws that require contracts to be governed by the mandatory provisions of the local laws of the consumer's country. In such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.
Out-of-Court Resolution of Disputes. We always strive to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Nord, please try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written notice of dispute at support@nordaccount.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved, you or Nord may bring a formal proceeding.
Judicial Resolution of Disputes. You and Nord agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to the Terms will be brought in the courts of Panama. If you reside in a country (including countries of the European Union) where laws provide consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, in such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.
Online Dispute Resolution in the EU. If you are a consumer, you may report the dispute to a consumer dispute body in your country of residence, in accordance with local regulations and practices. If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.

For the avoidance of doubt, extensions or “plugins” developed by the Licensee as original works for the purpose of adding new functionality or customizing the Software shall not be considered Improvements. The Licensee may use such extensions or “plugins” for any purpose and may distribute them to any person or third parties without prior written permission from The Regents.

The Licensee agrees that any Improvements made by Licensee shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as the Software. Licensee agrees not to assert a claim of infringement in Licensee copyrights in Improvements in the event The Regents prepares substantially similar modifications or derivative works. The Licensee agrees to use his/her reasonable best efforts to protect the contents of the Software and to prevent unauthorized disclosure by its agents, officers, employees, and consultants.

Notwithstanding the above, Licensee may disclose any Improvements that do not involve disclosure of the Software.

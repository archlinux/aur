3.  Restrictions.

(a) 	Compliance with Sales Documentation. Your use of the Software
must comply with this License, applicable Documentation, quote, and
license file for such Software (collectively, "Sales Documentation"),
including, but not limited to, any restrictions on the number of
protected applications, number or type of licensed devices, number
of authorized copies or instances, number of users, bandwidth,
non-production use, database, or location restrictions. We, or an
authorized third party on our behalf, reserve the right to audit
your use of the Software and to disable any use not in compliance with
the Sales Documentation, in addition to any other rights and remedies
available to us.

(b) 	Versions. Your use of the Software under this License may be
limited to certain versions, as set forth in the applicable Sales
Documentation (for example, a "version plus" license may be limited
to a certain number of major updates). To the extent your Sales
Documentation contains such limitations, your use of versions or
releases of the Software that are not contemplated in your Sales
Documentation is prohibited and shall be considered a material breach
of this License.

(c) 	Nontransferability. Unless otherwise set forth in the Sales
Documentation or in a separate agreement between you and us, you may
not transfer or attempt to transfer Software that you obtain as part of
Hardware to other Hardware, third-party hardware, or any virtualized
environment.

(d) 	Licensed Features. Software provided in stand-alone form (for
example, a virtual machine image) requires a valid license key or other
similar identifying token ("Token") issued to you by F5 or an F5
authorized reseller and you may only use the Software for the duration
of time the license key or Token permits. F5 may employ mechanisms in
the Software designed to ensure that you are only able to access the
Software and features that you have licensed.  Except for
Non-production and Evaluation Software, if your license key or Token
allows you to deploy or use Software or features prior to executing an
order for such Software or features, you agree to submit payment for
the use of such Software or features in accordance with your payment
terms with F5 or your F5 authorized reseller.

(e) 	Other Restrictions. Except as otherwise expressly permitted in
this License, you must not, and must not allow any parent, subsidiary,
affiliate, agent or third party to:

(1) 	copy (except to make one archival copy for backup and disaster
recovery purposes), modify or create derivative works of the Software
or Documentation;

(2) 	sell, sub-license, rent, service bureau, grant usage rights or
transfer the Software, any data incorporated into the Software ("Data")
or any associated Documentation to any unauthorized third party;

attempt to derive the source code of the Software or any Data except as
required by law for interoperability purposes, and then only after you
have given us an opportunity to resolve such interoperability issue;

(4) defeat, circumvent or disable any reporting, copy protection or
other mechanism in the Software used to limit license duration or
access to non-licensed functionality or capacity.

(f) 	Software Specific Restrictions.

(1) Non-Production Use Software.  Software designated as
"non-production," "non-commercial," "lab" or "development" in the
applicable Sales Documentation ("Non-Production Software") may only
be used to conduct testing and development in your non-production
environment and may not manage or protect data traffic or applications
in the ordinary course of your business.

(2) Evaluation Software.  Software designated as "evaluation," "test,"
"trial" or similar in the applicable Sales Documentation ("Evaluation

evaluation purposes and not in a production environment.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS LICENSE, WE DISCLAIM
ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, FOR NON-PRODUCTION AND EVALUATION
SOFTWARE AND IT IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. Evaluation Software
has a non-perpetual time limited license that, depending on the
Software, will time-out and disable the Evaluation Software upon
expiration of the evaluation period. You will not use any Evaluation
Software beyond the prescribed license duration.

(3)  Software Hosted in a Public Cloud.  If you use the Software in a
public cloud environment, you may only use the Software in object code
form in the cloud provider's ("Cloud Provider") environment.  In
accordance with Section 3(e), you may not copy any portion of the
Software out of the Cloud Provider environment.  Each instance of the
Software running in the Cloud Provider's environment requires its own
license key when you are using a bring-your-own-license offering from
the Cloud Provider.  If you are using a utility offering (e.g., hourly)
from the Cloud Provider, you will purchase licenses or subscriptions
from the Cloud Provider's marketplace.  IN ADDITION TO THE DISCLAIMERS
SET FORTH IN SECTION 8(d) BELOW, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY TERMS TO THE
CONTRARY IN THIS LICENSE OR ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF THE
APPLICABLE CLOUD OR SIMILAR ENVIRONMENT, SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY A CLOUD
PROVIDER AND NOT OBTAINED FROM F5 IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND POSSIBLY

is not "Software" as such term is defined herein. If applicable, the
ModSecurity Module will be provided by us with the applicable NGINX
Software, and is subject to the terms set forth at

(a) Infringement Defense. We will, at our expense, defend any suit
brought against you by an unaffiliated third party based upon a
claim that the Software infringes a valid patent, trademark or
copyright or misappropriates a third-party trade secret. The terms
"misappropriation" and "trade secret" are used as defined in the
Uniform Trade Secrets Act, except in case of claims arising under any
claim governed by the laws of any jurisdiction outside the United
States, in which case "misappropriation" will mean intentionally
unlawful use and "trade secret" will mean "undisclosed information"
as specified in Article 39.2 of the Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. We will pay costs
and damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) finally awarded
against you, or agreed in settlement by us, directly attributable
to any such claim and will bear all reasonable costs of the
investigation and defense of the claim, but only on condition that
(1) you notify us in writing of such claim promptly following receipt
of notice; (2) we have sole control of the defense and settlement
negotiations; (3) you provide us all information and communications
received by you concerning such claim; and (4) you provide reasonable
assistance to us when requested. You will have the right to
participate in the defense with counsel of your choice at your expense,
provided that such representation does not interfere with our right to
control the defense.

(b)  Exclusive Liability. We will have the right, at our option and
expense, to (1) obtain rights for you to use the Software; (2) replace
or modify the Software so that it becomes non-infringing; or (3) accept
return of the Software, upon which the applicable license(s) will
terminate, in exchange for a credit, with respect to perpetually
licensed Software, not to exceed the purchase price paid by you for
such Software based upon a three (3) year straight line depreciation,
and with respect to subscription Software, based on the applicable
pro-rated portion ofthe amount paid for the corresponding payment term,
calculated monthly. The remedies set forth in this Section 9, subject
to the restrictions set forth in Sections 9(c) and 10 below, state
our exclusive liability to you concerning infringement and
misappropriation.

(c)  	Restrictions.  We will have no liability for any claim of
infringement based on (1) use of a superseded release of the Software
where the subsequent release is equally available to you at no cost
and is non-infringing; (2) use of the Software in combination with
equipment or software not supplied by us (including Open Source
Components) where the Product would not itself be infringing; (3) use
of the Software in an application or environment not described in the
Documentation; (4) software or technology not developed by us;
(5) Software that has been altered or modified in any way by anyone
other than us or our authorized agents; (6) your continued use of the
Software after we notify you to discontinue use due to such a claim; or
(7) any other use of the Software in violation of the terms of this
License.

OR SERVICES FURNISHED TO YOU BY US, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, OUR LICENSORS WILL
NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER THIS
LICENSE. SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING, THE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY OF US
AND OUR LICENSORS (a) FOR PERPETUAL LICENSED SOFTWARE LICENSED UNDER
THIS LICENSE WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE
AND (b) FOR SOFTWARE OTHER THAN PERPETUAL LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL BE
LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12)
MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS
CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF
AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY PROVIDED UNDER ANY TERM OF
THIS LICENSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR
EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. IN
THOSE JURISDICTIONS, SUCH INAPPLICABILITY WILL NOT AFFECT THE
REMAINDER OF THE PROVISIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Date of last revision: 2011-10-05 (Complete revision, removed trading feature,

These Terms of Use (‚ÄúTerms‚Äù) apply to the use of the Wuala Cloud Storage
(‚ÄúService‚Äù) by you (‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚ÄúCustomer‚Äù). The Service is provided
by LaCie AG, Davidsbodenstrasse 15A, 4004 Basel, Switzerland (‚ÄúLaCie‚Äù). IF
YOU WISH TO USE the Service, YOU MUST AGREE TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE
TO THE TERMS, ANY USE OF the SERVICE IS UNAUTHORIZED, AND YOU SHOULD STOP
ACCESSING THE SERVICE IMMEDIATELY. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE WILL
CONSTITUTE ASSENT TO THESE TERMS. You represent that: (a) you have full legal
capacity to contractually obligate yourself to these Terms; (b) you have read,
understood and accepted these Terms; and (c) you have not violated these or
other terms provided by LaCie previously.
   1. **** Use of Service ****
         1. LaCie operates an cloud storage system named Wuala ("Service"). The
            system consists of the client software ("Client Software"), the
            website ("Website") and the Wuala network ("Network"). It enables
            its users to store and access files over the Internet, and to share
            them with selected other users. The Client Software and the Website
            can differ in features and appearance, depending on which Service
            (the "Product") is used and the used system.
         2. Subject to these Terms, LaCie agrees to provide the Service to
            Customer.
         3. LaCie agrees that all files you store using the Service, including
            their metadata (file name, description, comments, thumbnail images,
            etc.), ("Data") will be encrypted such that they can neither be
            read by LaCie nor by any third party, unless the Data is
            explicitely shared or made public by you. LaCie has no access to
            your password, does not know it and cannot reset or recover it. You
            acknowledge that if you forget your password, your Data will be
            irrevocably lost.
         4. Depending on the Product, the Client Software can consist of one or
            more different programs running on your PC and/or other devices.
            These programs can come pre-installed on your device or might need
            to be downloaded and installed by the Customer. You are responsible
            to keep the Client Software up to date. For some programs or pieces
            of the Client Software, updates are performed automatically. In
            other cases, you may need to download and install the latest
            version of the Client Software or the complete firmware of the
            device to keep the Client Software up to date. If the Client
            Software is not kept up to date, the Service may cease to be
            available or may not properly perform.
         5. As part of the evolution of the Service, LaCie may discontinue,
            modify or add new features to the Service without prior notice to
            you.
   2. **** Customer Obligations and Responsibilities ****
         1. Customer shall use the Service in compliance with all applicable
            laws, including without limitation the laws of Switzerland, and in
            accordance with such usage policies and guidelines as LaCie may
            establish from time to time. Usage policies and guidelines are
            published on the Website.
         2. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with Customer‚Äôs use
            of the Service, Customer shall not: (a) use the Service to change,
            damage, delete or edit Data without authorization; (b) attempt to
            access the Service with unauthorized software; (c) use the Service
            in a way that infringes the intellectual property, privacy or other
            rights of third parties or otherwise causes damage to any third
            party; (d) use the Service, directly or indirectly, to offer any
            service that competes with the Service; (e) use the Service to gain
            unauthorized access to files stored on the Network by other users;
            (f) use the Service to gain unauthorized access to any other
            computer or network; (g) use the Service to facilitate any mass
            mails, spam, chain letters, snowball systems, or similar
            communications, regardless of whether they are commercial in
            nature; (h) store or transmit any software or data containing any
            virus, malware, worm, trap-door, Trojan Horse, spyware or other
            software or program code that is malicious in nature; (i)
            misrepresent Customer‚Äôs identity, including without limitation by
            representing that Customer is a LaCie employee or representative or
            another user of the Service; (j) use the Service to collect, store
            or transmit personal data of any person without such person‚Äôs
            consent; (k) or participate in any group that encourages violation
            of LaCie‚Äôs terms and policies; (l) send us untruthful abuse
            reports; (m) fraudulently gain or attempt to gain access to the
            Network; or (n) gain or attempt to gain cloud storage resources the
            Customer is not entitled to, including without limitation the use
            of a promotional code Customer is not eligible to use or the
            creation of multiple user accounts for the purpose of gaining
            additional cloud storage.
         3. Customer shall bear responsibility for all activities conducted
            under Customer‚Äôs account, whether by Customer or a third party.
         4. LaCie does not monitor the data stored or distributed through use
            of the Service, and assumes no responsibility for such data.
            Customer acknowledges that in using the Service, Customer may be
            exposed to content which Customer may find to be insulting,
            offensive, or otherwise objectionable. Customer waives any claim
            against LaCie, its affiliates, and their officers, directors,
            agents, and employees based upon the content of data stored or
            distributed through use of the Service.
         5. Customer agrees to maintain the accuracy of Customer‚Äôs account
            details at all times. LaCie will use the email address specified in
            your account details or suitable means of communication within
            Wuala to inform you about legally binding declarations (for example
            modifications of these Terms, blocking/cancellation etc.) or send
            you other notices. It is your responsibility to regularly check
            your email account for new emails and to make sure emails from
            LaCie can pass your spam and/or other filters. ANY COMMUNICATIONS
            FROM LACIE TO CUSTOMER SHALL BE DEEMED GIVEN IF SENT TO CUSTOMER AT
            THE EMAIL ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THE CUSTOMER‚ÄôS ACCOUNT DETAILS,
            INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY AMENDMENTS TO THESE TERMS AND ANY
            NOTICE THAT CUSTOMER‚ÄôS ACCOUNT WILL BE BLOCKED OR CANCELLED.
         6. It is the Customer‚Äôs responsibility to choose a secure password,
            to retain the password, and to maintain the password‚Äôs security.
            In case the password is lost, all data stored online becomes
            inaccessible and cannot be recovered.
         7. Customer shall refrain from any activity which interferes or may
            interfere with the efficiency of the Service (for example through
            software or other scripts). This includes without limitation
            excessive use of the Service or using the Service in ways for which
            it is not intended.
   3. **** Termination ****
         1. LaCie reserves the right to block Data and/or to terminate user
            accounts for any reason LaCie in good faith determines to be

   5. **** Available Storage Space ****
         1. La Cie will display available storage and storage usage in the
            Client Software, but La Cie makes no warranty that the display is
            current or accurate.
         2. LaCie may provide the Customer with a basic amount of cloud storage
            (e.g. 1 GB) at no charge as communicated on the Website. Addition
            cloud storage may be obtainable for a fee, through relevant
            promotional codes, bundled with other LaCie products, through La
            Cie‚Äôs referral program as communicated on the Website or other
            offers.
         3. Depending on the Product, Customer can subscribe to additional
            storage according to the storage plans communicated on the Website.
            LaCie reserves the right to change the available plans at any time.
            Payments for additional storage space are made in advance for the
            relevant period and are non-refundable. LaCie may in its sole
            discretion accept payments by credit card, PayPal or other means of
            payments acceptable to LaCie. You agree to notify LaCie prior to
            any purchase in case you are not a business customer and/or you
            have no VAT registration¬ in¬ the country where you have your place
            of business, or a permanent establishment for which the delivery is
            made, or, in the absence of such a place of business or such a
            permanent establishment, your place of residence or the place from
            which you work. The purchased additional storage will be made
            available after reception of the payment, but at most three working
            days after the reception of the payment. If Customer chooses a plan
            with automatic renewal, the plan will automatically be renewed for
            the same period and same amount of storage unless LaCie or Customer
            cancels the plan fourteen days before expiration by email
            (sales@wuala.com ).
         4. When obtaining cloud storage through any offer (including
            subscriptions, promotional codes, product bundlings, gift cards,
            etc.), terms and conditions that are specific to that offer may
            apply. Customer agrees to abide by such terms when making use of
            any offer. If not stated otherwise, unredeemed offers expire after
            a period of six months.
         5. If you fill your cloud storage, no additional Data can be uploaded
            until the available storage capacity exceeds the amount of Data
            stored. In case the available storage is exceeded, LaCie may
            terminate your account as described in section 3.4 .
         6. All orders are subject to acceptance by LaCie. In case of errors or
            omissions in a published offer (e.g. on the Website), LaCie can
            correct them prior to acceptance of the order.
   6. **** Abuse ****
      If LaCie becomes aware of a misuse of the Service or any violation of

      action LaCie considers appropriate.
   7. **** Privacy Policy ****
         1. The customer and LaCie are bound by the privacy policy of the
            Service [http://www.wuala.com/about/privacy ]. LaCie shall comply
            with applicable laws and regulations regarding data privacy.
         2. Customer agrees that LaCie may transmit any data stored by Customer
            to a third party if LaCie believes in good faith that it is
            required to do so in order to: (a) comply with any law or order
            issued by any legal authority; (b) avoid infringement of the rights
            of a third party; or (c) protect the property of LaCie or the
            personal safety of its users and the public.
   8. **** Disclaimer of Warranty ****
         1. Customer acknowledges the inherent risks involved in online data
            storage, including without limitation the risk of destruction or
            loss of data. LACIE PROVIDES ALL SERVICES ‚ÄúAS IS‚Äù AND WITH ALL
            FAULTS. THE ENTIRE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICES IS ASSUMED BY
            CUSTOMER. LACIE EXTENDS NO WARRANTIES TO CUSTOMER OR TO ANY OTHER
            PERSON, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
            MERCHANTABILITY, WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
            WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES ARE OF ANY PARTICULAR QUALITY.
         2. The Service may contain links to other websites and services. LaCie
            has no influence on the contents of these linked pages, dissociates
            itself herewith explicitely from all such contents, and makes no
            warranty whatsoever with respect to such links, websites, or
            services.
   9. **** Limitation of Liability ****
         1. IN NO EVENT WILL LACIE BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING FOR THE
            CONDITION, EXISTENCE, OR LOSS OF DATA SENT TO LACIE OR THE DATA
            LACIE RECOVERS) EVEN IF IT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
            SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS ON THE LEGAL
            THEORY ON WHICH THE CLAIM IS ASSERTED (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, CONTRACT, BREACH OF CONTRACT, AND TORT). Some states do
            not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties or
            liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above
            limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.
         2. LaCie will not be liable to Customer or to any other person for
            failure to perform or any delay in the performance of the Service
            due to fire, flood, war, riot, strike, explosion, lock out,
            injunction, natural disaster, interruption of transportation, acts
            of war, terrorism, labor disputes, acts of civil or military
            authority, power blackouts, computer viruses, or any other event
            beyond LaCie‚Äôs reasonable control.
         3. Customer agrees that the sole and exclusive remedy for
            unsatisfactory services shall be termination of the Service and a
            refund of any amount actually paid by Customer for the then current
            service term. LACIE‚ÄôS LIABILITY OF ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THE
            SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY NEGLIGENCE ON ITS PART, SHALL BE LIMITED TO
            THE AMOUNT CUSTOMER HAS PAID LACIE FOR THE SERVICES FOR THE THEN
            CURRENT TERM OF SERVICE.
  10. **** Indemnification ****
      CUSTOMER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS LACIE AND ITS
      EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS, AND AGENTS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND
      ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, SUITS, ACTIONS, DEMANDS,
      PROCEEDINGS (WHETHER LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE), AND EXPENSES (INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS‚Äô FEES) ARISING FROM OR RELATED
      TO (A) ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY CUSTOMER; (B) ANY USE OF THE

      countries where our data recovery facilities are located. You agree to
      comply with all customs and export laws and all other applicable laws,
      statues, ordinances and regulations relating to use of the Service. You
      acknowledge that violations of these Terms could subject you to criminal
      or civil penalties.
  12. **** Modifications ****
      CUSTOMER AGREES THAT LACIE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION TO
      AMEND THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FROM TIME TO TIME AND THAT ANY SUCH
      AMENDMENT SHALL BE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE EARLIER OF THE DATE LACIE SENDS
      CUSTOMER AN EMAIL TO THE ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN THE CUSTOMER'S ACCOUNT
      DETAILS OR THE DATE LACIE OTHERWISE NOTIFIES CUSTOMER OF THE CHANGE
      (E.G., BY DISPLAYING THE NOTICE IN THE CLIENT SOFTWARE). NOTWITHSTANDING
      THE FOREGOING, IF CUSTOMER HAS PURCHASED STORAGE AND IS USING SUCH
      ADDITIONAL STORAGE AT THE TIME OF THE CHANGE, CUSTOMER MAY OBJECT TO ANY
      CHANGE IN THESE TERMS BY PROVIDING LACIE WITH NOTICE WITHIN 10 DAYS OF
      THE DATE OF THE NOTICE TO CUSTOMER. UPON RECEIPT OF SUCH OBJECTION, LACIE

      STORAGE NOT YET USED; OR (B) CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE PURSUANT TO
      THE TERMS IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO THE CHANGE, IN WHICH EVENT THE CHANGE

            thereby.
         2. The failure of either party to exercise any rights provided for in

            on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). The

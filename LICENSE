defined in 48 C.F.R. Section 2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software”, and/or “Commercial
Computer Software Documentation,” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. Section 12.212 (or 48 C.F.R.
Section 227.7202, as applicable) and may only be licensed to or shared with U.S. Government end users
in object code form as part of, or embedded within, Authorized Systems. Any agreement pursuant to
which you share the Licensed Software will include a provision that reiterates the limitations of this

CRITICAL APPLICATIONS. In some cases, NXP may promote certain software for use in the
development of, or for incorporation into, products or services (a) used in applications requiring fail-safe

environmental damage (these products and services are referred to as “Critical Applications”). NXP’s
goal is to educate customers so that they can design their own end-product solutions to meet applicable
functional safety standards and requirements. Licensee makes the ultimate design decisions regarding
its products and is solely responsible for compliance with all legal, regulatory, safety, and security
related requirements concerning its products, regardless of any information or support that may be
provided by NXP. As such, Licensee assumes all risk related to use of the Licensed Software in Critical
Applications and NXP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SUCH USE IN CRITICAL APPLICATIONS BY LICENSEE.
Accordingly, Licensee will indemnify and hold NXP harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages and
associated costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that NXP may incur related to Licensee’s
incorporation of the Licensed Software in a Critical Application.

Software in confidence perpetually. You may not disclose any part of the Licensed Software to anyone
other than distributees in accordance with Section 2.3 and employees, or subcontractors in accordance
with Section 2.5, who have a need to know of the Licensed Software and who have executed written
agreements obligating them to protect such Licensed Software to at least the same degree of
confidentiality as in this Agreement. You agree to use the same degree of care, but no less than a
reasonable degree of care, with the Licensed Software as you do with your own confidential
information. You may disclose Licensed Software to the extent required by a court or under operation oflaw or order provided that you notify NXP of such requirement prior to disclosure, which you only
disclose the minimum of the required information, and that you allow NXP the opportunity to object to
such court or other legal body requiring such disclosure.

understandings, agreements or representations, either written or oral, if any. This Agreement may only
be amended in written form, signed by you and NXP.
19.
SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is held for any reason to be invalid or
unenforceable, then the remaining provisions of this Agreement will be unimpaired and, unless a
modification or replacement of the invalid or unenforceable provision is further held to deprive you or
NXP of a material benefit, in which case the Agreement will immediately terminate, the invalid or
unenforceable provision will be replaced with a provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes
closest to the intention underlying the invalid or unenforceable provision.
20.
NO WAIVER. The waiver by NXP of any breach of any provision of this Agreement will not
operate or be construed as a waiver of any other or a subsequent breach of the same or a different
provision.
21.

limited license rights granted under this Agreement for three years following expiration or termination
of this Agreement. NXP will have the right, either itself or through an independent certified public
accountant to examine and audit, at NXP’s expense, not more than once a year, and during normal
business hours, all such records that may bear upon your compliance with the limited license rights
granted above. You must make prompt adjustment to compensate for any errors and/or omissions

Many suggestions from fans on the bay12games.com and other forums (and the
#bay12games IRC channel) have been incorporated over the years.  The code
contributions credited above that are in use by the game are distributed with
the Linux version (see the g_src directory and licenses below).

*** OPTIPNG ******************************************

optipng is bundled into the zip for use to change BMPs into PNGs easily, at
least until PNG support is added to DF itself.  The license is included in this
folder.  You can get the optipng documentation and source at
http://optipng.sourceforge.net.  You can use the compress_bitmaps batch file to
convert any BMP in the folder to PNG.  The BMP files are deleted afterward.

*** NOTES ON MODIFICATIONS ***************************

Existing save files will become unusable if any raw/objects entries are removed.
If you change the configuration of the bodies of existing creatures, save files
may become unstable.  New additions to the files are not incorporated into
existing worlds but will be added to the next world you generate.

We do not accept submissions for the official Dwarf Fortress releases.  Please
do not ask for your code, art, sound or raw/objects txt files to be incorporated
into the official releases.

the SDL port).  This code was distributed under the following license (and will

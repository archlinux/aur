1. The digitally encoded machine readable font software for producing the typefaces licensed to
you is the property of Tiro Typeworks. It is licensed to you for use under the terms of this end
user license agreement. If you have any questions about this license agreement, or have a need to
use the font software in a way not covered by this agreement, please write to license@tiro.com.

2. You may use this font software free of charge for all non-commercial purposes. If you wish to

Literature at sblfonts@sbl-site.org, or write to license@tiro.com. Fees for commercial licenses
are at the individual discretion of the Society of Biblical Literature and Tiro Typeworks.

3. You may redistribute this font software free of charge as long as the software is unmodified,
all copyright and trademark notices are intact, and the font contains or is accompanied by a copy
of this license agreement. You may not charge any fee for the distribution of this font software or
alter the terms of this license agreement.

4. You may decompile and modify this font software for non-commercial and personal use by

Unison is to be used for non-commercial purposes only! You may edit it for your own use, but do not distribute modified versions of Unison or any instruments/ sounds within that were created by me. EMU's terms and conditions of use apply to the rest of the instruments/sounds (Music Box, Jazz Guitar, Brass, Soprano Sax, Solo Vox, and Space Voice.)

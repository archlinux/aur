Miscellaneous Legal Terms

Below are some explicit definitions of legal terms.
Indemnity

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Blix Inc. and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to BlueMail, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of these Terms; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or intellectual property rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your data or any that is submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of BlueMail with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.
No Warranty

BlueMail is provided on an “as-is” and “as available” basis. Use of BlueMail and the software is at your own risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, BlueMail and the software is provided without warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Without limiting the foregoing, Blix Inc. and its licensors, do not warrant that the content is accurate, reliable or correct; that BlueMail or the software will be available at any particular time or location, uninterrupted or secure; that any defects or errors will be corrected; or that BlueMail or the software is free of viruses or other harmful components. Any content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of BlueMail is downloaded at your own risk and you will be solely responsibly for any damage to your computer system or mobile device or loss of data that results from such download or use of the service.
Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Blix Inc., its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, suppliers or licensors be liable for (a) any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not Blix Inc. has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (b) any claims, proceedings, liabilities, obligations, damages, losses or costs in an amount exceeding the greater of $20 or the mounts paid by you to Blix Inc. for the past three months of the services in question. Some states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you. BlueMail is controlled and operated from facilities in the United States and other countries. Blix Inc. makes no representations that BlueMail is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use BlueMail from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.
Notification Procedures and Changes to these Terms

Blix Inc. may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Blix Inc. in our sole discretion. Blix Inc. reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in these Terms. Blix Inc. is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Blix Inc. may, in its sole discretion, modify or update these Terms from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of BlueMail after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to access) BlueMail.
Governing Law

Governing Law: These Terms and the use of BlueMail services and software will be governed by the law of the State of New York, NY, USA except for its conflicts of laws principles. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York City, NY, except for injunctive or other equitable relief which may be served in a court of competent jurisdiction as the case may be to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights.

Amicable dispute resolution: For any dispute with Blix Inc., you agree to first contact us at privacy@bluemail.me and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Blix Inc. has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Blix Inc. claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in New York, NY, unless you and Blix Inc. agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, intellectual property rights, or other proprietary rights. All claims must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims. You agree that, by entering into this agreement, you and Blix Inc. are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Blix Inc with respect to BlueMail, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to BlueMail. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Blix Inc.’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but may be assigned by Blix Inc. without restriction. Blix Inc. and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.

Please contact us support@bluemail.me with any questions regarding these Terms.

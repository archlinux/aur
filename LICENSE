Your possibilities to cancel the Subscription and/or get a refund may differ depending on whether you purchased Services from (or are billed through) Nord or a third party (e.g., app store, service provider, retailer).

Payment of Refund. Your request will be processed without any unreasonable delay and the refund will be paid using the same payment method as the one used for the purchase, except as otherwise mutually agreed, unless applicable law prohibits us or payment service providers we rely on from processing the refund. For payments made in cryptocurrency, the refund will be made in the same cryptocurrency or in another cryptocurrency if the one used for the purchase becomes unavailable or impracticable to use.

Governing Law. These Terms will be governed by the law of Panama except for its conflicts of laws principles. However, some countries (including countries of the European Union) have laws that require contracts to be governed by the mandatory provisions of the local laws of the consumer's country. In such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.
Out-of-Court Resolution of Disputes. We always strive to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Nord, please try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us a written notice of dispute at support@nordaccount.com that includes your name, a detailed description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. We will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved, you or Nord may bring a formal proceeding.
Judicial Resolution of Disputes. You and Nord agree that any judicial proceeding to resolve claims relating to the Terms will be brought in the courts of Panama. If you reside in a country (including countries of the European Union) where laws provide consumers the right to bring disputes in their local courts, in such cases, mandatory provisions of the local laws of your country of residence apply.
Online Dispute Resolution in the EU. If you are a consumer, you may report the dispute to a consumer dispute body in your country of residence, in accordance with local regulations and practices. If you reside in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, the European Commission provides for an online dispute resolution platform, which you can access here: https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr.
CLASS ACTION WAIVER
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

WHERE PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND NORD AGREE THAT EACH SHALL ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Nord agree, no arbitrator or judge shall consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
MISCELLANEOUS
Availability of Services. Actual coverage, speeds, locations, and quality of Services may vary. Nord attempts to improve and provide Services at all times. However, our Services may be not available without a prior notice or Nord's liability, including when (i) we test, update, expand, add, or remove our Services, features, functionalities, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements (ii) we experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance or human errors; (iii) events beyond our control (e.g., events in nature and other force majeure events) happens.
Modification and Termination of Services. We reserve the right to modify or update the operation of the Services at our sole discretion, at any time, for any reason, and without notice or liability. We may also suspend the Services entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so. If you have prepaid fees directly to Nord for a paid Subscription that Nord permanently discontinues prior to the end of its period, Nord will refund you the pro rata part of such prepaid fees for the period after such discontinuation (except for cases referred to in Section 12.1 of these General Terms), and in such case your Account and billing information must be up to date in order for us to refund you. Nord has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of the authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.
Severability. If any provision of the Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid by any competent authority, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that other provisions of the Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
Assignment. You may not assign these Terms or any rights or interest under these Terms or delegate any obligations to be performed under these Terms, without the Nord's prior written consent. Nord can assign, transfer, delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms to selected third parties without your consent, including but not limited to, in cases of corporate reorganization, merger, acquisitions, sale, or transfer of all or substantially all of company assets.

Third-Party Components. You acknowledge that our Services, Software, and Websites, may incorporate, embed, be combined with, or may otherwise interact with third party computer programs, applications, services, links, and components (“Third-Party Components”). For the avoidance of doubt, Section 9 (“Disclaimer of Warranties”) and Section 10 (“Limitation of Liabilities”) of these General Terms apply to the foregoing interaction with Third-Party Components.

Linking to our Websites. You may link to our Websites, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it, but you must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part where none exists.
Communication with Nord. You may provide notices, requests, information, and other communications to Nord via our customer support. You agree to receive communications from us electronically, e.g., by email, through our applications, and customer support platforms, and consent that such notifications have the same legal power as communication in writing.

When communicating with our customer support representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. In addition, you undertake to provide accurate data for communication with us and, if your contact details have changed, update them in your Account immediately. Nord is not liable if you do not receive certain notices regarding the Services upon your failure to update your contact details.

Export Laws. Nord products may be subject to the United States (U.S.) and European Union export and re-export control laws and regulations or similar laws applicable in other jurisdictions, including the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR“) maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce. You warrant that you are (i) not located in any country to which the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom or other relevant jurisdiction has embargoed goods or has otherwise applied any economic sanctions, which would forbid or limit the use, import, export, sale of, or payment for the Services; and (ii) not a denied party as specified in any applicable export or re-export laws or regulations or similar laws applicable in relevant jurisdictions or otherwise listed on any list of prohibited or restricted parties as administered by the Office of Foreign Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC“), the U.S. Department of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty's Treasury of the United Kingdom, or other relevant sanctions authority (“Sanctions Authorities”). You agree to comply with all applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations, including without limitation the EAR and trade and economic sanctions maintained by OFAC as it may be applicable to you. Specifically, you agree not to - directly or indirectly - use, sell, export, reexport, transfer, divert, release, or otherwise dispose of any Nord Services, including products, software, or technology (notwithstanding products derived from or based on such technology) received from under these Terms to any destination, entity, or person or for any end-use prohibited by the applicable export control laws, trade and economic sanctions maintained by Sanctions Authorities or any applicable laws or regulations without obtaining any required prior authorization from the competent government authorities as required by those laws and regulations.
Exclusions. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so some limitations above may not apply to you.
Prevailing Language. For all purposes, the English language version of the Terms shall be the original, governing instrument and understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between this English language version of the Terms and any subsequent translation into any other language, the English language version shall govern and control.
Force Majeure. Nord shall not be in breach of the Terms nor liable for delay in performing, or failing to perform, any obligations under the Terms if such delay or failure result from unforeseen circumstances, events, or causes beyond Nord's reasonable control (including, without limitation, failures of third party software (whether open or not), failures of your telecommunication or internet service providers, force majeure, earthquakes, fires, floods, embargoes, labor disputes and strikes, riots, war, novelty of product manufacture or other unanticipated product development problems, and acts of civil and military authorities). In such cases, Nord shall be entitled to a reasonable extension of the time for performing any such obligations under the Terms.

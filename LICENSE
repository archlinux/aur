You acknowledge and agree that, if your confidential information is displayed as visual output of your computer while the Software is active, such confidential information may be included in a Screenshot, transmitted to Upwork, and displayed in the applicable work diary. In order to prevent transmission of your confidential information to Upwork, you agree not to access your confidential information while the Software is active. Although we have taken reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your computer via the Software, we cannot foresee or control the actions of third parties.

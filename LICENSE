The binary is created when you backup your records and is stored in the event that you need to recover your information due to local system crash, damage, loss or hack attempt that results in the self-destruction of your records. The Cloud Security Vault is also used to enable seamless synchronization of your records on your devices where Keeper is installed.

If your subscription expires and you choose not to renew your subscription within 90 days, Keeper Security reserves the right to delete any Keeper records contained in your account that have files (e.g. documents, photos, videos, etc.) contained in them.

After this file limit, a Free User will be required to purchase a paid storage plan.

Free User accounts are allowed to have up to two (2) vault records that contain Two-Factor TOTP codes. To use more Two-Factor codes within vault records a Free User will be required to purchase a paid Keeper plan (such as Unlimited, Family, Business, or Enterprise).

If you are a free user who has not utilized the Software within 12 months, Keeper Security reserves the right to terminate and delete your account. Notice will be sent to you prior to termination based on the email address associated with your Keeper account.

All users of the Software are required to adopt and maintain the Privacy Policy, which may be modified by Keeper Security from time to time.
